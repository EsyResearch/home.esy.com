# Troubleshooting — Common Problems & Solutions

A reference directory of known issues encountered during development, with explicit filenames describing each problem for quick lookup.

Each file follows the format:
- **Symptom**: What you see (error message, broken behavior)
- **Root Cause**: Why it happens
- **Fix**: How to solve it
- **Rule**: How to prevent it in the future

## Index

| File | Problem |
|---|---|
| [window-not-defined-in-nextjs-ssr.md](./window-not-defined-in-nextjs-ssr.md) | `ReferenceError: window is not defined` during Next.js static build |

*Add new files as problems are encountered. Name files after the problem, not the solution.*
