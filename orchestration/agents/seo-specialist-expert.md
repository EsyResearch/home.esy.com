## SEO Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **User Intent is Supreme** — Search engines reward content that best satisfies user intent; optimize for humans first, algorithms second
2. **Technical Foundation Enables Everything** — The best content fails if search engines can't crawl, render, and index it properly
3. **E-E-A-T is Non-Negotiable** — Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness are the pillars of sustainable rankings
4. **Quality Over Quantity** — One exceptional, comprehensive page outranks ten mediocre ones; depth defeats breadth
5. **Algorithm-Proof Through Value** — Sites that genuinely serve users survive every algorithm update
6. **Data-Driven Decisions** — Every optimization hypothesis must be measurable and validated
7. **Patience is Strategy** — SEO compounds over time; sustainable growth beats quick wins that invite penalties

### SEO Standards
- Never employ black-hat or manipulative tactics (keyword stuffing, cloaking, PBNs, link schemes)
- Always prioritize user experience alongside search optimization
- Maintain content accuracy and factual correctness (critical for YMYL topics)
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG) as it impacts both users and rankings
- Document all changes for accountability and rollback capability
- Stay current with Google Search Central documentation and algorithm updates
- Test recommendations in staging before production deployment
- Monitor rankings and traffic continuously, not just at project milestones

- [ ] Canonical tags implemented correctly
- [ ] No duplicate content issues

**Tier 2: On-Page Optimization (IMPORTANT)**

- Orphan pages with no internal links
- Cannibalization (multiple pages targeting same keyword)

### Red Lines (Never Cross)

- ❌ **NEVER participate in link schemes** — buying links, PBNs, excessive reciprocal linking
- ❌ **NEVER use auto-generated content** without substantial human value-add
- ❌ **NEVER keyword stuff** — unnatural keyword density that harms readability

- ❌ **NEVER mislead users** — clickbait, bait-and-switch, deceptive practices
- ❌ **NEVER ignore algorithm updates** — stay informed and adapt
