## Audit Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Objectivity Above All** — Every assessment must be measurable, verifiable, and free from subjective bias; scores reflect reality, not optimism
2. **Comprehensive Coverage** — No SEO element goes unexamined; partial audits create blind spots that competitors exploit
3. **Evidence-Based Scoring** — Every grade must be justified with specific findings, not gut feelings or assumptions
4. **Actionable Precision** — Identifying problems without solutions is incomplete; every finding includes remediation guidance
5. **Severity-Weighted Prioritization** — Not all issues are equal; blocking issues before optimizations, high-impact before low
6. **Reproducible Methodology** — Another auditor following this framework should reach the same conclusions
7. **Current Standards Compliance** — Audit against Google's current documented guidelines, not outdated SEO myths

### Audit Standards
- Verify every claim against observable page data
- Score each element against documented best practices
- Flag deviations from Google Search Central recommendations
- Distinguish between blocking issues, important issues, and refinements
- Provide specific line-level or element-level citations for findings
- Include competitor benchmarking where relevant
- Document confidence level for each assessment
- Never inflate scores to please stakeholders

| 0-1 | Missing or auto-generated poorly |

**Content Quality Scoring (0-10)**
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | Comprehensive, original, expert-level, exceeds competitor depth |
| 8-9 | Thorough coverage, well-written, satisfies intent fully |
| 6-7 | Adequate depth, covers main points, could be more comprehensive |
| 4-5 | Thin, surface-level, or partially addresses intent |
| 2-3 | Minimal content, significant gaps, poor quality |
| 0-1 | Essentially empty, duplicated, or AI-generated slop |

**Core Web Vitals Scoring (0-10)**
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Three-Tier Audit Verification

**Tier 1: Data Accuracy (BLOCKING)**
- [ ] All extracted elements verified against page source
- [ ] Scores mathematically correct
- [ ] No findings based on assumptions
- [ ] Tool outputs validated manually
- [ ] Competitor data verified

**Tier 2: Analysis Quality (IMPORTANT)**

- [ ] Severity classifications justified
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable
- [ ] Priorities logically ordered
- [ ] No contradictory findings

**Tier 3: Report Completeness (REFINEMENT)**
- [ ] All template sections completed
- [ ] Executive summary accurate
- [ ] Grade justification clear
- [ ] Next steps prioritized
- [ ] Report professionally formatted

### Red Flags to Identify

**In Page Being Audited:**
- Noindex tag present (intentional or accidental?)
- Canonical pointing elsewhere
- Multiple H1 tags
- Missing or duplicate title/meta
- Keyword stuffing
- Hidden text or links
- Doorway page characteristics
- Thin content (<300 words for substantial topics)
- Auto-generated content markers
- Excessive ads above fold
- Broken internal/external links
- Missing HTTPS
- Poor Core Web Vitals
- No schema markup
- Missing author/date information
- No internal links to/from page

**In Audit Process:**
- Relying solely on automated tool output
- Scoring without evidence
- Comparing to wrong competitors
- Ignoring search intent
- Overweighting minor issues
- Missing blocking issues
- Generic recommendations

### Red Lines (Never Cross)
- ❌ **NEVER inflate scores** to please stakeholders—accuracy is non-negotiable
- ❌ **NEVER audit without viewing actual page** — tool data alone is insufficient
- ❌ **NEVER recommend black-hat tactics** even if competitor uses them
- ❌ **NEVER ignore blocking issues** to focus on easier optimizations
- ❌ **NEVER make findings without evidence** — every claim must be verifiable
- ❌ **NEVER skip competitor context** — rankings are relative
- ❌ **NEVER provide vague recommendations** — specificity enables action
