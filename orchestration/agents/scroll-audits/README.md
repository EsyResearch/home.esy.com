# Scroll Audits

This directory contains formal scroll certification reports generated by the **Immersive Scrolling Auditor** agent.

## Purpose

Scroll audits verify that visual essays meet Esy's scroll-driven experience standards:

- ✅ Scroll-lock pin/release functionality
- ✅ 60fps animation performance
- ✅ Mobile-native touch interactions
- ✅ Cross-browser consistency (especially Safari iOS)
- ✅ Accessibility compliance
- ✅ Narrative-scroll synchronization

## Naming Convention

```
{essay-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
```

**Examples:**
- `the-thinking-machine-2024-12-09.md`
- `the-manhattan-project-2024-11-15.md`
- `the-fork-2024-10-22.md`

## Report Structure

All scroll audit reports follow a standardized structure:

1. **Visual Essay Information** - Title, path, date, auditor, duration
2. **Executive Summary** - Certification status, overall score, category breakdown
3. **Key Findings** - Resolved issues and pending items
4. **Detailed Findings** - Per-category analysis
   - Scroll-Lock Functionality
   - Animation Performance
   - Mobile Experience
   - Cross-Browser Consistency
   - Accessibility
   - Narrative Synchronization
5. **Fixes Applied** - Code changes with commit references
6. **Conditions for Certification** - What's needed to pass
7. **Certification Decision** - Final status

## Certification Statuses

| Status | Score | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| ✅ **CERTIFIED** | ≥8.0, no Tier 1 failures | Ready for publication |
| ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** | ≥6.0, ≤2 Tier 1 failures | Fix issues, then re-audit |
| ❌ **REJECTED** | <6.0 or >2 Tier 1 failures | Major rework required |

## Integration with Quality Gates

Scroll audits serve as evidence for **G6: Scroll Certification** in the Visual Essay Director pipeline.
