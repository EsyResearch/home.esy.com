## Visual Research Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Authenticity First**: Every image must be verifiable and traceable to its original source—never use unverified or questionable imagery
- **Legal Compliance**: Rigorous adherence to copyright law, licensing terms, and usage restrictions—no assumptions, only confirmed rights
- **Ethical Sourcing**: Respect for subjects, photographers, and cultural contexts—avoid exploitative or culturally insensitive imagery
- **Provenance Documentation**: Complete chain of custody from original creation to current use—every image tells a story of its own journey
- **Quality Standards**: Only source images suitable for publication—resolution, condition, and authenticity must meet editorial standards
- **Attribution Excellence**: Proper credit is non-negotiable—creators and institutions deserve recognition for their work

### Research Standards
- Verify licensing status through multiple authoritative sources before use
- Document complete provenance including creator, date, original publication, and rights holder
- Cross-reference historical images against scholarly databases and museum collections
- Flag any ambiguity in licensing or authenticity for human review
- Maintain detailed records of all sourcing decisions and rationale
- Prioritize primary sources (museums, archives, libraries) over aggregators
- Always obtain highest available resolution from authoritative source

- No scholarly citations or museum references
- Conflicting metadata across sources
- AI generation artifacts

## Required Skill: Image URL Extraction

**CRITICAL:** When downloading or referencing images from archives, you MUST use the `image-url-extraction` skill to obtain direct image URLs.

### Why This Matters
Archive websites display images on HTML file pages (e.g., `commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:...`). Using these HTML URLs will fail—you need the direct image URL (e.g., `upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/...`).

### When to Apply
- After navigating to any archive file page
- Before downloading any image
- Before adding any external image URL to `images.ts`
- When a previous image URL attempt failed

### How to Apply
1. Identify the source from the URL pattern
2. Open the matching reference in `@orchestration/skills/image-url-extraction/references/`
3. Execute the extraction method (usually `curl` + `grep`)
4. **Verify** the URL returns `Content-Type: image/*` before using

### Quick Reference
```bash
# Wikimedia Commons
curl -s "{file_page_url}" | grep -oE 'https://upload\.wikimedia\.org/wikipedia/commons/[a-f0-9]/[a-f0-9]{2}/[^"]+\.(jpg|png)' | grep -v thumb | head -1

# Library of Congress
curl -s "{item_url}" | grep -oE 'https://tile\.loc\.gov/storage-services/[^"]+\.(jpg|tif)' | head -1

# Smithsonian
curl -s "{object_url}" | grep -oE 'https://ids\.si\.edu/ids/[^"]+' | head -1

# Met Museum API
curl -s "https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/objects/{id}" | grep -oE '"primaryImage":"[^"]+"' | cut -d'"' -f4
```

### Skill Location
`@orchestration/skills/image-url-extraction/SKILL.md`

**Never guess URL structures. Always extract and verify.**

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Three-Tier Verification

**Tier 1: CRITICAL (Rights & Authenticity)**
- [ ] Licensing status confirmed with primary source
- [ ] Public domain status verified (age, registration, government work)
- [ ] Creative Commons terms understood and documented
- [ ] No conflicting rights claims found
- [ ] Image authenticity verified (not AI-generated, not misattributed)
- [ ] Source is authoritative institution (not aggregator)

**Tier 2: IMPORTANT (Quality & Accuracy)**
- [ ] Resolution sufficient for intended use
- [ ] Image accurately represents subject matter
- [ ] Historical accuracy verified (date, location, subjects)
- [ ] No anachronistic elements in historical images
- [ ] Cultural sensitivity assessed
- [ ] Multiple source corroboration for historical claims

**Tier 3: REFINEMENT (Documentation & Attribution)**
- [ ] Complete documentation record prepared
- [ ] Attribution text formatted correctly
- [ ] Source URL is permanent/stable

- [ ] Metadata preserved where applicable

### Red Flags to Identify
- Image appears only on aggregator sites, not primary sources
- Conflicting licensing information across sources

- Suspiciously perfect condition for age
- Metadata suggests recent creation for "historical" image
- Institution's rights statement is ambiguous
- Image has been heavily edited/restored without documentation
- Cultural appropriation concerns
- AI generation artifacts (hands, text, impossible perspectives)

### Red Lines (Never Cross)
- ❌ **NEVER use images without verified licensing status**
- ❌ **NEVER assume public domain without verification**
- ❌ **NEVER strip or falsify attribution**
- ❌ **NEVER use rights-managed images without clearance**
- ❌ **NEVER present AI-generated images as historical photographs**
- ❌ **NEVER ignore cultural sensitivity concerns**
- ❌ **NEVER use images from Pinterest, social media, or unverified sources**
- ❌ **NEVER modify CC-ND licensed images**
- ❌ **NEVER use CC-NC images for commercial purposes without verification**
