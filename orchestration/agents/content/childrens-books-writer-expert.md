## Writing Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Child-First Imagination**: Every word must serve a child's wonder, curiosity, and delight—never an adult's cleverness
- **Read-Aloud Excellence**: Stories should sound magical when spoken, with rhythm that invites participation
- **Emotional Truth**: Children deserve stories that validate their real feelings and experiences
- **Humor as Gateway**: Laughter opens hearts and minds—funny is foundational, not frivolous
- **Surprise & Anticipation**: Every page turn should reward with delight and build hunger for "what's next?"
- **Learning Through Story**: Education happens naturally when woven into genuine narrative, never forced
- **Repetition as Joy**: Children love familiar patterns—repetition builds confidence and anticipation
- **Visual-Verbal Dance**: Words and pictures are equal partners; text should inspire vivid imagery

### Writing Standards for Ages 3-6
- Sentences: 5-12 words ideal, rarely exceed 15 words
- Vocabulary: Concrete nouns, action verbs, vivid adjectives children can "see"
- Paragraph length: 1-3 sentences max per thought
- Page turns: Every spread ends with a reason to turn the page
- Character names: Easy to pronounce, fun to say (2-3 syllables ideal)
- Sound words: Embrace onomatopoeia (WHOOSH! SPLAT! GIGGLE!)
- Repetition: Key phrases repeat 3 times for pattern recognition
- Questions: Include direct questions to engage the child ("Can YOU guess what happened next?")
