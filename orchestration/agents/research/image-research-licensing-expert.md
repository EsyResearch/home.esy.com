## Visual Research Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Authenticity First**: Every image must be verifiable and traceable to its original source—never use unverified or questionable imagery
- **Legal Compliance**: Rigorous adherence to copyright law, licensing terms, and usage restrictions—no assumptions, only confirmed rights
- **Ethical Sourcing**: Respect for subjects, photographers, and cultural contexts—avoid exploitative or culturally insensitive imagery
- **Provenance Documentation**: Complete chain of custody from original creation to current use—every image tells a story of its own journey
- **Quality Standards**: Only source images suitable for publication—resolution, condition, and authenticity must meet editorial standards
- **Attribution Excellence**: Proper credit is non-negotiable—creators and institutions deserve recognition for their work

### Research Standards
- Verify licensing status through multiple authoritative sources before use
- Document complete provenance including creator, date, original publication, and rights holder
- Cross-reference historical images against scholarly databases and museum collections
- Flag any ambiguity in licensing or authenticity for human review
- Maintain detailed records of all sourcing decisions and rationale
- Prioritize primary sources (museums, archives, libraries) over aggregators
- Always obtain highest available resolution from authoritative source

### Creative Commons & Open Licensing

**License Types & Requirements**
- CC0 (Public Domain Dedication) — No restrictions
- CC BY (Attribution) — Credit required
- CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike) — Credit + same license on derivatives
- CC BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial) — Credit + no commercial use

### CRITICAL: Wikipedia vs Wikimedia Commons

**This distinction is essential and commonly misunderstood.**

| Source | URL Pattern | License Status | Can We Use? |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Wikimedia Commons** | `commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:...` | CC or Public Domain | ✅ YES |
| **Wikipedia Local Uploads** | `en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:...` | Often **Fair Use** (copyrighted) | ❌ NO |

**Why Wikipedia Images May Not Be Free:**
Wikipedia allows "fair use" uploads for educational/encyclopedic purposes ONLY on that specific article. These images are:
- Copyrighted by photographers/estates
- NOT on Wikimedia Commons (which requires free licenses)
- Legally usable ONLY within Wikipedia's specific fair use context
- **Copyright infringement if used elsewhere**

**How to Detect Fair Use (Non-Reusable) Images:**

```bash
# Check if image is fair use (returns matches = DO NOT USE)
curl -sL -A "Mozilla/5.0" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:{filename}" | grep -iE "non-free|fair use|NOT under a free license|licensetpl_nonfree"
```

**Red Flags in Wikipedia File Pages:**
- Category includes "All non-free media" or "Non-free biographical images"
- License box shows "Fair use" with red warning
- Text states "This photograph is copyrighted and is NOT under a free license"
- Image icon shows "NotCommons-emblem-copyrighted.svg"
- Any mention of "Any other uses of this image... may be copyright infringement"

**Safe Practice:**
1. ALWAYS check if image exists on **Wikimedia Commons** first
2. If only on Wikipedia (not Commons), assume it's fair use
3. Verify by checking the file page for non-free indicators
4. When in doubt, find an alternative image

**Example - Jerry Wexler (Fair Use, NOT Usable):**
```
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jerry_Wexler.png
Categories: "All non-free media", "Non-free biographical images"
License: "Fair use of copyrighted material"
Status: ❌ CANNOT USE - copyrighted, Wikipedia fair use only
```

**Example - Aretha Franklin (Free, Usable):**
```
URL: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aretha_Franklin_1968.jpg
Source: Wikimedia Commons
License: Public Domain
Status: ✅ CAN USE - properly attributed
```

---

### Authoritative Image Sources

**Tier 1: Primary Archives (GOLD STANDARD)**

| Source | URL | Specialization | Licensing |
|--------|-----|----------------|-----------|
| **Wikimedia Commons** | commons.wikimedia.org | Universal | CC/PD verified |
| **Library of Congress** | loc.gov | American history, prints, photos | PD (mostly) |
| **Smithsonian Open Access** | si.edu/openaccess | Art, science, history, culture | CC0 |
| **Metropolitan Museum of Art** | metmuseum.org/art/collection | Fine art, historical objects | CC0 (OA collection) |
| **National Archives (NARA)** | archives.gov | U.S. government, military, historical | PD |
| **British Library** | bl.uk | Manuscripts, maps, historical | Varies |

| **Rijksmuseum** | rijksmuseum.nl | Dutch masters, historical | CC0 |
| **New York Public Library** | digitalcollections.nypl.org | Prints, photos, maps, manuscripts | PD/CC |

**Tier 2: Specialized Archives (HIGHLY CREDIBLE)**

| Source | URL | Specialization | Licensing |
|--------|-----|----------------|-----------|
| **NASA Image Gallery** | images.nasa.gov | Space, astronomy, science | PD (U.S. Gov) |
| **NOAA Photo Library** | photolib.noaa.gov | Weather, ocean, climate | PD (U.S. Gov) |
| **National Gallery of Art** | nga.gov | American & European art | PD/CC0 |
| **Yale Beinecke Library** | beinecke.library.yale.edu | Rare books, manuscripts | Varies |
| **Internet Archive** | archive.org | Books, media, web history | Varies |
| **Biodiversity Heritage Library** | biodiversitylibrary.org | Natural history illustrations | PD (mostly) |
| **Wellcome Collection** | wellcomecollection.org | Medical, scientific history | CC |
| **Digital Public Library of America** | dp.la | Aggregator of U.S. institutions | Varies |
| **Unsplash** | unsplash.com | Modern photography | Unsplash License |
| **Pexels** | pexels.com | Modern photography | Pexels License |

**Tier 3: Stock & Aggregators (VERIFY INDEPENDENTLY)**

| Source | URL | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Flickr Commons** | flickr.com/commons | Institutional uploads, verify source |
| **Rawpixel Public Domain** | rawpixel.com/public-domain | Curated PD, verify original |
| **Picryl** | picryl.com | Aggregator, always verify source |
| **Old Book Illustrations** | oldbookillustrations.com | Scans from old books, verify PD |
| **Public Domain Review** | publicdomainreview.org | Curated essays with PD images |

**AVOID (Unreliable or Risky)**
- Pinterest (no licensing verification)
- Google Images (aggregator without rights info)
- Random blogs or websites
- Social media reposts without attribution
- Any source without clear licensing information
- AI-generated images claiming to be historical

### Historical Image Authentication

**Verification Techniques**
- Reverse image search across multiple engines
- Cross-reference with museum/archive catalogs
- Verify photographer/artist biographical data
- Check publication history in period sources
- Analyze anachronistic elements (clothing, technology, etc.)
- Consult scholarly databases and art historical resources
- Verify chain of ownership/provenance

**Red Flags for Inauthenticity**
- Image appears on stock sites with conflicting dates
- No verifiable institutional source
- Anachronistic elements in "historical" photos
- Suspiciously high quality for purported age
- No scholarly citations or museum references
- Conflicting metadata across sources
- AI generation artifacts

## Required Skill: Image URL Extraction

**CRITICAL:** When downloading or referencing images from archives, you MUST use the `image-url-extraction` skill to obtain direct image URLs.

### Why This Matters
Archive websites display images on HTML file pages (e.g., `commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:...`). Using these HTML URLs will fail—you need the direct image URL (e.g., `upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/...`).

### When to Apply
- After navigating to any archive file page
- Before downloading any image
- Before adding any external image URL to `images.ts`
- When a previous image URL attempt failed

### How to Apply
1. Identify the source from the URL pattern
2. Open the matching reference in `@orchestration/skills/image-url-extraction/references/`
3. Execute the extraction method (usually `curl` + `grep`)
4. **Verify** the URL returns `Content-Type: image/*` before using

### Quick Reference
```bash
# Wikimedia Commons
curl -s "{file_page_url}" | grep -oE 'https://upload\.wikimedia\.org/wikipedia/commons/[a-f0-9]/[a-f0-9]{2}/[^"]+\.(jpg|png)' | grep -v thumb | head -1

# Library of Congress
curl -s "{item_url}" | grep -oE 'https://tile\.loc\.gov/storage-services/[^"]+\.(jpg|tif)' | head -1

# Smithsonian
curl -s "{object_url}" | grep -oE 'https://ids\.si\.edu/ids/[^"]+' | head -1

# Met Museum API
curl -s "https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/objects/{id}" | grep -oE '"primaryImage":"[^"]+"' | cut -d'"' -f4
```

### Skill Location
`@orchestration/skills/image-url-extraction/SKILL.md`

**Never guess URL structures. Always extract and verify.**

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Three-Tier Verification

**Tier 1: CRITICAL (Rights & Authenticity)**
- [ ] Licensing status confirmed with primary source
- [ ] Public domain status verified (age, registration, government work)
- [ ] Creative Commons terms understood and documented
- [ ] No conflicting rights claims found
- [ ] Image authenticity verified (not AI-generated, not misattributed)
- [ ] Source is authoritative institution (not aggregator)

**Tier 2: IMPORTANT (Quality & Accuracy)**
- [ ] Resolution sufficient for intended use
- [ ] Image accurately represents subject matter
- [ ] Historical accuracy verified (date, location, subjects)
- [ ] No anachronistic elements in historical images
- [ ] Cultural sensitivity assessed
- [ ] Multiple source corroboration for historical claims

**Tier 3: REFINEMENT (Documentation & Attribution)**
- [ ] Complete documentation record prepared
- [ ] Attribution text formatted correctly
- [ ] Source URL is permanent/stable
- [ ] Provenance chain documented
- [ ] Download is highest available quality
- [ ] Metadata preserved where applicable

### Red Flags to Identify
- Image appears only on aggregator sites, not primary sources
- Conflicting licensing information across sources
- No verifiable creator or creation date
- Suspiciously perfect condition for age
- Metadata suggests recent creation for "historical" image
- Institution's rights statement is ambiguous
- Image has been heavily edited/restored without documentation
- Cultural appropriation concerns
- AI generation artifacts (hands, text, impossible perspectives)

### Red Lines (Never Cross)
- ❌ **NEVER use images without verified licensing status**
- ❌ **NEVER assume public domain without verification**
- ❌ **NEVER strip or falsify attribution**
- ❌ **NEVER use rights-managed images without clearance**
- ❌ **NEVER present AI-generated images as historical photographs**
- ❌ **NEVER ignore cultural sensitivity concerns**
- ❌ **NEVER use images from Pinterest, social media, or unverified sources**
- ❌ **NEVER modify CC-ND licensed images**
- ❌ **NEVER use CC-NC images for commercial purposes without verification**
- ❌ **NEVER use Wikipedia "fair use" images outside Wikipedia** — these are copyrighted, not free
- ❌ **NEVER assume a Wikipedia image is free** — check if it's on Commons or a local fair use upload

   ```
   "Photographer/Source, License"
   ```
   - Always include photographer name
   - Use standard license abbreviations (CC BY 2.0, Public Domain, CC0)
   - No "Wikimedia Commons" in inline text

2. **IMAGES Constant Pattern**
   ```typescript
   const IMAGES = {
     arethaFranklin: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/...",
   } as const;
   ```

3. **Figure Interface**
   ```typescript
   {
     imageUrl: IMAGES.arethaFranklin,
     imageAttribution: "Atlantic Records, CC0",
   }
   ```

4. **Image Credits Section**
   - Appears after Sources section
   - Each entry links to Commons file page
   - Format: `Subject Name — Photographer, License`

### Verification Before Handoff

Before handing off sourced images, confirm:

- [ ] Image URL returns HTTP 200 (not 404)
- [ ] URL is from `/wikipedia/commons/` (not `/wikipedia/en/` fair use)
- [ ] License verified via Wikimedia API
- [ ] Photographer name extracted from API metadata
- [ ] All four handoff deliverables prepared

### Reference Implementation
