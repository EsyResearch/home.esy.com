## 🟡 Important Issues (Should Fix)

### Issue 1: Marshall Quote Specificity
- **Category**: Quote Attribution
- **Location**: Chapter 10 (Civil Rights)
- **Description**: Thurgood Marshall quote cites "Supreme Court opinion" without case name
- **Evidence**: "In recognizing the humanity of our fellow beings, we pay ourselves the highest tribute."
- **Recommended Fix**: Add specific case citation or change to "— Thurgood Marshall, from the bench"
- **Severity**: Low — quote is correctly attributed to Marshall's judicial writing

**[x] Approve as-is** | **[ ] Defer** | **[ ] Reject**

## 🟢 Polish Suggestions (Nice to Have)

### Suggestion 1: Deepen Source Links
- Some publisher homepage links (penguinrandomhouse.com) could link to specific book pages
- Recommend using ISBN-based links or direct book pages where available

### Suggestion 2: Add DOI References
- For the OED citations, consider adding specific entry DOIs when available
- This improves long-term link stability

**Auditor Notes**:
This essay demonstrates exemplary citation practices for sensitive educational content. The research package in the orchestration directory provides comprehensive sourcing documentation. All quotes trace to verifiable primary sources. The Sources section appropriately balances accessibility (Gutenberg, Oyez) with scholarly authority (OED, academic press publications, national archives).

The only minor suggestion is to add case specificity to the Marshall quote, but this does not block publication as the quote is correctly attributed to his judicial writing.
