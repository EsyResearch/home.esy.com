## Executive Summary

This etymology essay traces the 700-year semantic journey of the word "toy" from medieval dalliance to modern plaything. The essay demonstrates strong citation practices with Tier 1 sources (OED, Middle English Dictionary, academic presses, museums) and comprehensive research documentation. However, **two critical link integrity issues** were identified: the OED entry link returns 404, and the V&A Museum toys collection link is broken. The essay contains numerous factual claims that require verification against sources, particularly regarding Shakespeare's usage statistics, historical dates, and dictionary definitions.

## 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Publishing)

### Issue 1: Broken OED Link
- **Category**: Link Integrity
- **Location**: Sources section, line 143
- **Description**: The Oxford English Dictionary entry link returns 404 Not Found
- **Evidence**: 
  - URL: `https://www.oed.com/dictionary/toy_n1`
  - Browser verification: Returns 404 page
  - This is the PRIMARY etymology source for the essay
- **Recommended Fix**: 
  1. Search OED website for correct URL format for "toy" entry
  2. Verify the entry exists and is accessible
  3. If OED requires subscription, note this in the source or find alternative Tier 1 etymology source
  4. Consider using OED's public search or alternative access method
- **Suggested Source**: 
  - Alternative: `https://www.oed.com/search?q=toy` (search results page)
  - Or verify subscription requirement and note: "OED subscription required"

**[ ] Approve fix** | **[ ] Defer** | **[ ] Reject**

### Issue 2: Broken V&A Museum Link
- **Category**: Link Integrity
- **Location**: Sources section, line 148
- **Description**: V&A Museum of Childhood toys collection link returns 404
- **Evidence**:
  - URL: `https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/toys`
  - Browser verification: Returns 404 "The page you were looking for doesn't exist"
- **Recommended Fix**:
  1. Search V&A website for current toys collection URL
  2. Alternative: `https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/childhood` (if Museum of Childhood has separate URL)
  3. Or use general V&A collections search: `https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?q=toys`

  - Or link to V&A Museum of Childhood homepage if separate: `https://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/`

**[ ] Approve fix** | **[ ] Defer** | **[ ] Reject**

## 🟡 Important Issues (Should Fix)

### Issue 3: Shakespeare Usage Statistics Need Verification
- **Category**: Claim-Citation Mapping
- **Location**: Multiple sections claiming "Shakespeare used 'toy' 30+ times"
- **Description**: The essay repeatedly states Shakespeare used "toy" "over thirty times" or "30+ times" but this specific statistic is not directly cited
- **Evidence**:
  - Line 2024: "Shakespeare used 'toy' over thirty times—never once meaning a child's plaything"
  - Line 2066: "Used 'toy' 30+ times, never meaning 'child's plaything'"
  - CITATIONS.md line 68: "Shakespeare used 'toy' 30+ times, never meaning 'child's plaything'"
- **Recommended Fix**:
  1. Verify exact count through Folger Shakespeare Library search
  2. Add specific citation: "Folger Shakespeare Library corpus search reveals [X] instances"
  3. Or qualify: "Shakespeare used 'toy' numerous times (at least 30 instances)"
- **Suggested Source**: Folger Shakespeare Library search tool (already in sources but needs specific search result)

**[ ] Approve fix** | **[ ] Defer** | **[ ] Reject**

### Issue 4: Dictionary Definitions Need Direct Citations
- **Category**: Claim-Citation Mapping
- **Location**: Dictionary Archaeology scroll-lock sequence (lines 717-721)
- **Description**: Multiple dictionary definitions are presented without direct page/section citations
- **Evidence**:
  - Johnson 1755 definition: "A petty commodity; a trifle; a thing of no value. Also: Amorous dalliance."
  - Victorian 1888 definition: "A thing of little value; a trifle; a plaything"
  - Modern 2024 definition: "A thing for a child to play with"
- **Recommended Fix**:
  1. Add specific dictionary edition citations for each definition
  2. For Johnson: Cite specific page number or entry number from 1755 Dictionary
  3. For Victorian: Identify specific dictionary (which one from 1888?)
  4. For Modern: Cite OED current entry (once link is fixed)
- **Suggested Source**: 
  - Johnson's Dictionary: Digital facsimile available at various libraries
  - Victorian dictionaries: Identify specific publisher/edition

**[ ] Approve fix** | **[ ] Defer** | **[ ] Reject**

### Issue 5: Historical Dates Need Source Verification
- **Category**: Claim-Citation Mapping

### Issue 6: Quote Attribution Needs Verification
- **Category**: Claim-Citation Mapping
- **Location**: Quote Monument components
- **Description**: Several quotes are presented without full source context
- **Evidence**:
  - Line 2008: Peter Damian quote on Byzantine customs (c. 1060) - appears unrelated to toy etymology
  - Line 2034: Hamlet quote "These are but wild and whirling toys" - needs act/scene citation
  - Line 2070: "This is a very scurvy toy of Fortune's" - needs play identification (Much Ado About Nothing)
- **Recommended Fix**:
  1. Add act/scene citations for Shakespeare quotes
  2. Verify Peter Damian quote relevance to essay topic
  3. Add full source citations for all quoted material
- **Suggested Source**: Folger Shakespeare Library for Shakespeare quotes

## 🟢 Polish Suggestions (Nice to Have)

### Suggestion 1: Add Specific Shakespeare Play Citations
- **Location**: Shakespeare Shuffle scroll-lock (lines 872-878)
- **Description**: Shakespeare quotes are listed with play names but could include act/scene numbers
- **Recommendation**: Add act/scene citations for academic completeness

### Suggestion 2: Clarify Museum Collection Links
- **Location**: Sources section
- **Description**: Museum links go to homepages rather than specific collection pages
- **Recommendation**: Add direct links to toy-specific collections or note that links are to institution homepages

### Suggestion 3: Add Publication Dates to Academic Sources
- **Location**: Sources section
- **Description**: Academic books are listed but publication dates could be more prominent
- **Recommendation**: Include publication dates in source titles for clarity

## Auditor Certification

- [ ] All core claims have Tier 1-2 support — **🟡 Partial** (2 broken links, some unsupported claims)
- [ ] All quotes are verified and attributed — **🟡 Partial** (Shakespeare quotes need act/scene, Locke/Rousseau are paraphrases)
- [ ] All links are functional and accessible — **❌ Failed** (2 broken links)
- [ ] Source tier distribution meets standards (80%+ Tier 1-2) — **✅ Pass** (100% Tier 1)
- [ ] No Tier 4 sources present — **✅ Pass**
- [ ] Citation format is consistent — **✅ Pass**

**Certification Status**: ⏳ **Pending** — Critical link issues must be resolved before approval

**Auditor Notes**:

This essay demonstrates excellent citation practices overall with 100% Tier 1 sources and comprehensive research documentation. The CITATIONS.md file is well-structured and properly synced with the essay sources. However, **two critical link integrity issues** prevent full certification:

1. **OED Link (Critical)**: The primary etymology source returns 404. This must be fixed as the OED is the definitive source for the essay's core claims about first appearance (c. 1303) and etymology.

2. **V&A Museum Link (Critical)**: The toys collection link is broken. While this is a supporting source, broken links undermine citation credibility.

**Recommendations**:
- Fix OED link immediately (highest priority)
- Fix V&A link or find alternative museum source
- Verify Shakespeare usage statistics with Folger Library search
- Add specific citations for dictionary definitions (page numbers, entry numbers)
- Clarify Locke/Rousseau quotes (are they paraphrases or direct quotes?)
- Add act/scene citations for Shakespeare quotes

Once these critical issues are resolved, this essay will meet certification standards. The foundation is strong—these are primarily technical fixes rather than fundamental citation problems.
