## 🟡 Important Issues (Should Fix)

### Issue 1: Missing research/ directory in essay folder
- **Category**: Research Directory Structure
- **Location**: `src/app/essays/why-venezuela-matters/`
- **Description**: The research directory exists in `orchestration/skills/visual-essay-invocation/research/why-venezuela-matters/` but not in the essay folder itself
- **Recommended Fix**: Create symlink or copy CITATIONS.md to essay folder's `research/` directory for consistency with other essays

**[ ] Approve fix** | **[x] Defer** | **[ ] Reject**

*Note: This is a structural preference, not a content issue. The citations exist and are accessible.*

### Issue 2: Some statistics lack inline source notes
- **Category**: Claim-Citation Mapping
- **Location**: Throughout essay text
- **Description**: Some statistics in the body text could benefit from inline source notes (e.g., "(EIA 2025)")
- **Recommended Fix**: Add parenthetical source notes for key statistics, particularly in FAQ answers

**[ ] Approve fix** | **[x] Defer** | **[ ] Reject**

*Note: The Sources section is comprehensive; inline notes would be polish, not critical.*

## 🟢 Polish Suggestions (Nice to Have)

### Suggestion 1: Add DOI links for academic sources
- **Description**: Where available, add DOI links for more stable citation
- **Example**: USGS publication has DOI: `https://doi.org/10.3133/fs20093028`

### Suggestion 2: Archive.org backup for news links
- **Description**: Consider Wayback Machine snapshots for breaking news URLs that may change
- **Rationale**: Breaking news URLs often get updated or restructured

**Auditor Notes**:

This essay represents a model for breaking news visual essay citation practices:

1. **Real-time verification**: The FactBox component's explicit categorization of confirmed/unverified/unknown information is exemplary for developing stories.

2. **Multi-source validation**: Key claims are corroborated across multiple Tier 1-2 sources (Reuters + AP + PBS for operational facts; EIA + USGS + OPEC for energy data).

3. **Transparency on uncertainty**: The essay honestly acknowledges what remains unknown (who controls Venezuela, how "running the country" works operationally).

4. **Disinformation awareness**: Including the EBU/WIRED AI image fact-check demonstrates responsible journalism.

5. **Legal analysis depth**: Using Just Security and WOLA for legal analysis, not just news outlets, shows sophistication.

**Recommendation**: This essay can proceed to publication. Consider adding inline source notes as a future polish pass.
