## :yellow_circle: Important Issues

### Issue 1: Sources Section Link Placeholders

- **Category**: Link Integrity
- **Location**: RockAndRollClient.tsx lines 1104-1127 (sources object)
- **Description**: Several book sources use `"#"` as placeholder URLs instead of actual links to purchase/library pages
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  { title: "The Sound of the City: The Rise of Rock and Roll - Charlie Gillett", url: "#" },
  { title: "Unsung Heroes of Rock 'n' Roll - Nick Tosches", url: "#" },
  ```
- **Recommended Fix**: Replace `"#"` with actual URLs to WorldCat, publisher pages, or library catalog entries
- **Suggested Sources**:
  - WorldCat for library holdings: worldcat.org
  - Publisher pages for in-print books
  - Google Books for preview links

**[ ] Approve fix** | **[ ] Defer** | **[x] Low Priority**

### Issue 2: Documentary Links Missing

- **Category**: Link Integrity
- **Location**: RockAndRollClient.tsx lines 1121-1127 (documentaries array)
- **Description**: Documentary sources use `"#"` placeholders
- **Evidence**:

- **Suggested Sources**: IMDb, PBS, Amazon Prime, Criterion Channel

**[ ] Approve fix** | **[ ] Defer** | **[x] Low Priority**

## :green_circle: Polish Suggestions

### Suggestion 1: Add DOIs for Academic Sources

- **Category**: Link Stability
- **Description**: Academic sources in CITATIONS.md would benefit from DOI links where available for long-term stability
- **Benefit**: DOIs are permanent identifiers that won't break over time
- **Example**: Add DOI for Jack Hamilton's *Just Around Midnight* if available

### Suggestion 2: Add Archive.org Backup Links

- **Category**: Link Integrity
- **Description**: Consider adding Wayback Machine backup links for key web sources
- **Benefit**: Protects against link rot over time
- **Implementation**: Use format `[Title](primary-url) ([archived](archive.org-url))`

### Suggestion 3: Expand Sources Section Categories

- **Category**: Format & Consistency
- **Description**: Consider adding "Academic" category to Sources section to highlight scholarly sources
- **Benefit**: Signals research rigor to readers
