## 🟢 Polish Suggestions (Nice to Have)

### Suggestion 1: Consider Adding Werner Quote
- **Category**: Enhancement
- **Description**: The research package includes a verified quote from Werner (2014): "Banks create credit and purchasing power ex nihilo (out of nothing)." This could strengthen the Stage 2 section.
- **Current State**: Werner is listed in sources but not directly quoted
- **Suggested Addition**: Add as secondary quote in Stage 2 to provide academic perspective alongside Bank of England

**[x] Deferred** — Essay already has strong quote support; optional enhancement.

### Suggestion 2: Add Access Notes for Paywalled Sources
- **Category**: User Experience
- **Description**: The Werner (2014) academic paper is behind a ScienceDirect paywall. Consider adding a note for readers or linking to a preprint/institutional copy.
- **Current State**: Link works but requires subscription
- **Suggested Fix**: Add "(academic access required)" notation

**[x] Deferred** — Standard for academic sources; not a barrier.
