## Issues Identified

### Important Issues

#### Issue 1: Pepsi Creation Date Discrepancy
- **Category**: Claim-Citation
- **Location**: Era 3 / Pharmacy Counter section
- **Description**: Essay states "Caleb Bradham created Pepsi-Cola in 1893" but NCpedia indicates the beverage was created "in the late 1890s" with the name "Pepsi-Cola" adopted in 1898 and trademark registered in 1902-1903.
- **Evidence**: NCpedia states: "In the late 1890s he produced a beverage of his own creation... In 1898, however, for reasons no one knows, young Bradham changed the name to 'Pepsi-Cola.'"
- **Recommended Fix**: Change to "Caleb Bradham created Brad's Drink in 1893 (renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898)" OR align with scholarly consensus on the 1893 date if alternate sources support it.
- **Severity**: Minor (the 1893 date is widely cited, including by Pharmacy Times)

**[ ] Approve fix** | **[x] Defer** | **[ ] Reject**

*Note: The 1893 date appears in Pharmacy Times and is widely used in popular sources. The discrepancy may reflect when the beverage was first created vs. when it was formally named/trademarked.*

### Polish Suggestions

#### Suggestion 1: Daily Servings URL Update
- **Category**: Link Integrity
- **Location**: CITATIONS.md
- **Description**: The Coca-Cola FAQ URL in the essay bibliography and CITATIONS.md returns 404. The working URL is on the Nigeria subdomain.
- **Recommended Fix**: Update URL in bibliography from `coca-colacompany.com/faqs/...` to `coca-cola.com/ng/en/about-us/faq/...`

**[ ] Approve fix** | **[ ] Defer** | **[ ] Reject**

2. **Source Quality Excellence**: 100% Tier 1-2 sources with no Wikipedia-only claims
3. **Corporate Source Balance**: Uses Coca-Cola Company archives for specific claims while balancing with academic and journalistic sources
