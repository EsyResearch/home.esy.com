### Quotes Verification

| # | Quote | Attribution | Source | Status |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | "She did not touch food with her fingers..." | Peter Damian, c. 1062 | De Institutione Monialis | ⚠️ Attributed |
| 2 | "The Italian cannot by any means endure..." | Thomas Coryat (implied) | Coryat's Crudities (1611) | ⚠️ Attributed |

**Quote Notes**: 
- Both quotes are from historical primary sources (Peter Damian's writings, Coryat's 1611 book)
- The Peter Damian quote is widely cited in academic sources with minor translation variations
- Status "Attributed" because original Latin/old English sources have multiple translations

## 🟡 Important Issues (Minor Improvements)

### Issue 1: Quote Verification Enhancement
- **Category**: Quote Attribution
- **Location**: Scandal Quote section (Peter Damian)
- **Description**: The Peter Damian quote is widely attributed but from a medieval Latin text with multiple translations
- **Evidence**: The quote appears in De Institutione Monialis; multiple translations exist
- **Recommended Fix**: Add note in Sources section: "Peter Damian's condemnation appears in his letters and *Institutio Monialis*"
- **Status**: ✅ **Already implemented** — Essay includes this note in the Sources section

### Issue 2: Wikipedia as Primary Gateway
- **Category**: Source Quality
- **Location**: Sources section (first source)
- **Description**: Wikipedia is listed as first source; while acceptable as gateway, ideally follow with primary sources
- **Evidence**: Wikipedia is Tier 2-3, not Tier 1
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding British Museum or V&A collection links for artifact verification
- **Severity**: 🟢 Polish (not blocking)

**[ ] Approve enhancement** | **[x] Defer** | **[ ] Reject**

## Auditor Notes

This visual essay demonstrates excellent citation integrity for a scrollytelling piece. The narrative about fork history is well-supported by:

1. **Primary sources**: Peter Damian's writings, Thomas Coryat's 1611 travelogue
2. **Museum sources**: Museum of the Home (UK) provides direct expertise
3. **Academic journalism**: National Geographic, Scientific American, History.com
4. **Book reference**: Bee Wilson's *Consider the Fork* (recommended further reading)

The only enhancement opportunity is adding direct museum collection links (V&A, British Museum) which already appear in the research package but could be surfaced in the Sources section for readers interested in artifact verification.

**Verdict**: Ready for publication. No blocking issues.
