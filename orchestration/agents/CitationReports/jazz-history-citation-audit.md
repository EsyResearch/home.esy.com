## :yellow_circle: Important Issues

### Issue 1: Morton Birth Year Discrepancy

- **Category**: Historical Accuracy
- **Location**: Chapter I, Jelly Roll Morton figure profile
- **Description**: Essay states Morton was born "c. 1890" which is correct, but the figure also notes his 1938 interviews where he claimed 1885. The FIGURES.md clarifies this discrepancy.
- **Status**: :white_check_mark: HANDLED CORRECTLY
- **Evidence**: Essay uses "c. 1890" which aligns with scholarly consensus (Marquis, LOC records)
- **Assessment**: No fix needed; correctly presents documented birth year

### Issue 2: Keppard Recording Refusal Story

- **Category**: Hedging Language
- **Location**: Chapter II, "The story goes that..."
- **Description**: The claim that Keppard refused recording to prevent theft is not directly documented from Keppard himself
- **Status**: :white_check_mark: HANDLED CORRECTLY
- **Evidence**: Essay uses "The story goes that he feared others would 'steal his stuff'" with appropriate hedging
- **Assessment**: No fix needed; correctly uses "story goes" language per GAPS.md guidance

---

## :green_circle: Polish Suggestions

### Suggestion 1: Add Sources Section to Essay

- **Category**: Citation Visibility
- **Description**: While the essay has a SourcesSection component with bibliography, it could be expanded to include DOI links for academic sources
- **Benefit**: Enhanced verifiability for scholarly readers
- **Current Status**: Sources section exists (lines 853-885) with bibliography and image credits

### Suggestion 2: Consider Adding NEA Jazz Masters Links

- **Category**: Link Integrity
- **Description**: NEA Jazz Masters (arts.gov/honors/jazz) provides authoritative biographies for many figures; consider linking in figure profiles
- **Benefit**: Official government source for biographical verification

### Suggestion 3: Expand Swing Era Quote Diversity

- **Category**: Content Enhancement
- **Description**: Chapter IV has quotes from Ellington, Holiday, and Fitzgerald; consider adding Goodman or Basie quote for broader swing era coverage
- **Benefit**: Additional perspective on integration and swing
- **Available Quote**: Count Basie: "I think the band can swing just as much whether you play two notes or fifty notes." (QUOTES.md)

## Certification Status: :white_check_mark: CERTIFIED

**Recommendation**: APPROVED FOR PUBLICATION

The Jazz History visual essay demonstrates exemplary citation practices. The comprehensive research package (32+ sources, 55 figures, 88 timeline events, 33 verified quotes) provides robust support for all factual claims. Source tier distribution (90.6% Tier 1-2) significantly exceeds requirements. All 12 quotes used in the essay are verified against primary sources.

Particularly noteworthy is the essay's handling of disputed historical claims:
- The Storyville myth is explicitly debunked with citation to Bruce Boyd Raeburn (Tulane)
- The ODJB "invention" claim is correctly framed as "first recording" not "first jazz"
- Keppard's recording refusal uses appropriate hedging ("The story goes...")
- Morton's "invention" claim is noted as "exaggerated"
- Bebop's political nature is nuanced with Gillespie's own words

The research package demonstrates exceptional depth, particularly in ORIGINS-NEW-ORLEANS.md (426 lines of primary source documentation) and FIGURES.md (55 figures with verified dates, quotes, and photo archive sources).

All images are from the Library of Congress Gottlieb Collection (public domain since 2010) or Carl Van Vechten Collection (public domain), with proper attribution throughout.

**Auditor Notes**:
- This essay sets a high standard for historical jazz documentation
- The explicit myth-debunking demonstrates responsible scholarship
- Women's history chapter (IX) addresses historical erasure with specific documented examples
- Jazz Diplomacy paradox chapter (VIII) presents complexity without oversimplification
- Research package could serve as model for other music history essays
