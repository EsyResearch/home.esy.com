# Enhanced Master Prompt v2: "SLANG — A Typographic Visual Essay"

## ROLE

You are a world-class Etymologist + Historical Linguist + Brand Designer + Typographic Art Director.
You create museum-grade, editorial visual essays where typography is the main visual medium.

---

## PROJECT

Create a VISUAL ESSAY (NOT a photo essay) about the etymology, history, and cultural evolution of the word:
**"SLANG"**

The output should feel like a cohesive brand system applied to an editorial exhibit:
- typography-led compositions
- color systems with meaning
- iconography, patterns, and graphic motifs
- optional charts only when they genuinely add clarity

**NO photographs.** If you need historical "artifacts," recreate them typographically (as faithful typographic facsimiles), or as abstract/illustrative graphics.

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLES (Truth + Craft)

1. Do not invent sources, dates, "first uses," or quotations.
2. Every historical claim must be cited (footnotes/endnotes).
3. If the etymology is uncertain or contested, explicitly label it and present competing hypotheses with evidence.
4. Avoid moralizing "proper vs improper." Treat speech communities respectfully and precisely.
5. Typography choices must be justified by content, not vibes.

---

## DELIVERABLE FORMAT

Design the essay as either:
- **A)** a 12–18 panel "gallery wall" exhibit, OR
- **B)** a scrollytelling web essay with sections as panels.

(If medium is not specified, default to a 16:9 slide-like panel system that can be ported to web.)

---

## EACH PANEL MUST INCLUDE

1. **Panel Title** (short, strong)
2. **Subtitle** (1 line that teases intrigue)
3. **Body Copy** (120–200 words; vivid, engaging)
4. **A TYPOGRAPHIC HERO VISUAL** (type-as-image composition)
5. **A "Micro-Artifact" element** (choose one per panel):
   - dictionary entry facsimile (typographic recreation)
   - marginalia note (annotated, like a scholar's pencil marks)
   - pull quote (max 20 words, sourced)
   - mini-glossary capsule (2–3 terms)
   - stamp/seal (e.g., "ATTESTED 1750s" style)
6. **Citations** for all factual claims in that panel

---

## VISUAL LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS (No Photos)

**You may use:**
- typographic compositions
- abstract vector illustrations
- geometric shapes and patterns
- UI-like components (cards, tags, chips) for modern sections
- recreated "print textures" as vector/pattern (NOT photo scans)
- maps/diagrams as line art

**You may NOT use:**
- photographs
- "found" images framed as photos
- photorealistic portraits

---

## BRAND SYSTEM (MANDATORY OUTPUT)

Before writing the panels, generate a full brand system and then apply it consistently.

### 1) Brand Concept (choose 1 of 3 directions, then commit)

You MUST propose 3 distinct art-direction routes, each with:
- name + 2-sentence concept
- emotional tone (e.g., mischievous / scholarly / electric)
- what it signals about "slang"

Then choose 1 route and explain why it best matches the word's historical arc.

### 2) Color System

Create:
- a base palette (3 neutrals)
- 2–3 accent colors with roles (e.g., "Attestation Ink," "Gatekeeper Red," "Street Signal Yellow")
- accessibility notes (contrast, readability)
- rules for color usage by section/era (e.g., early history muted; internet era higher chroma)

### 3) Typography System (Type is the protagonist)

Specify:
- display type category (and examples) + rationale
- text type category (and examples) + rationale
- mono/annotation type category (and examples) + rationale
- hierarchy rules (H1/H2/body/captions/footnotes)
- typographic "behaviors" (tracking, leading, italics rules, small caps, underlines, redactions)

DO NOT just list fonts; explain why each category fits the historical/social tone.

### 4) Graphic Motifs

Create a small "visual vocabulary" of 6–10 motifs, each with meaning, such as:
- brackets [ ] for editorial labeling / stigma
- redaction bars for taboo / suppression
- speech-bubble fragments for oral culture
- arrows and callouts for linguistic analysis
- "rubber-stamp" shapes for dictionary authority
- glitch lines for digital-era acceleration
- hyphen/ligature motifs for word evolution

Define how they appear and what they signify.

### 5) Layout & Grid

Provide:
- grid (e.g., 12-column or 6-column)
- margins and spacing logic
- caption and footnote placement rules
- "museum placard" style for labels
- a consistent system for dates + sources

---

## CONTENT REQUIREMENTS (Research & Narrative)

Your essay must cover ALL of the following:

### A) The Hook: Why the word "slang" feels a little dangerous

- Make it fun, sensory, and immediate.

### B) Origin & Etymology (Forensic Section)

- earliest attestations (with verifiable citations)
- earliest meanings
- derived-from hypotheses
- what scholars disagree about (if applicable)

Include a **"Confidence Meter"** for each origin theory:
- Strong / Plausible / Speculative / Rejected (with reasons)

### C) Meaning Shift Over Time

Explain how "slang" changed as a label:
- from stigma/low speech framing (if supported)
- to broader descriptive term
- to modern linguistic framing

Clarify the difference between:
- "slang" as a phenomenon
- "Slang" as a word used by gatekeepers, writers, dictionaries, teachers, journalists

### D) Slang's Neighbors (Must include a comparison map)

Provide a typographic "concept constellation" comparing:
**slang vs cant vs argot vs jargon vs colloquial vs vernacular vs dialect**

Give crisp definitions and show overlaps visually.

### E) Timeline (Required, Typography-Forward)

Create a timeline with at least 16 milestones:
- date
- location
- medium (book, newspaper, academia, etc.)
- what changed (meaning, prestige, scope)
- citation

Timeline design must be described as a typographic component.

### F) U.S. + Global Spread

- U.S. usage and public discourse moments
- global English varieties and translation/loaning where supported
- include a non-photo map/diagram if it adds clarity (line-art is fine)

### G) Key Figures (No portraits; typographic identity cards)

Identify 8–12 key figures (lexicographers, linguists, writers, editors, cultural commentators) who shaped how the term "slang" was documented or discussed.

For each figure, produce a **"Typographic Identity Card"**:
- name as typographic centerpiece
- 60–90 word bio
- why they matter
- one sourced quote snippet (≤20 words) OR one cited contribution
- design treatment (e.g., serif authority vs punk poster energy)

### H) Modern Era: Internet as an engine

- acceleration, platform diffusion, meme velocity
- careful, respectful discussion of appropriation & power dynamics where relevant and sourced
- avoid stereotypes; be precise

### I) Ending: The thesis, sharpened

Close with a memorable final line that reframes "slang" as a mirror of belonging and change.

---

## CHARTS (OPTIONAL, NEVER FORCED)

Only include a chart if you have data + a citation.

If used, choose from:
- usage frequency over time (corpus-based)
- semantic shift map (conceptual, labeled as interpretive)
- timeline heat bands (density by era)
- network map of related terms (slang/cant/argot etc.)

Every chart must specify:
- what question it answers
- what data it uses
- its limitations

---

## OUTPUT ORDER (STRICT)

1. **Three Brand Directions** (3 options) + chosen direction + rationale
2. **Full Brand System:** color + type + motifs + grid + components
3. **Table of Contents** (12–18 panels)
4. **Panels** (each panel includes the 6 required elements)
5. **Timeline component** (full milestone list + design notes)
6. **Key Figures Typographic Cards** (8–12)
7. **Bibliography + source notes** (consistent style)

---

## QUALITY BAR

This must be publishable.
- No filler.
- No generic "slang is cool" statements.
- Make it visually specific even though it's text-only: describe typography and compositions so clearly a designer could build them.
