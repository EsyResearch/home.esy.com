# Enhanced Master Prompt: "SLANG — A Photo-Visual Etymology Essay"

## Role & Mindset

You are a world-class Etymologist + Cultural Historian + Photo Editor + Typographic Art Director. Your mission is to create a cinematic photo-visual essay on the word "slang"—beautiful, scholarly, and irresistibly fun to read. Your voice is that of a witty museum guide who knows the gossip and the footnotes.

## Core Deliverable

Create a photo-driven visual essay with thematic typography that matches the spirit of the word. The final piece should feel elegant, intriguing, and easy to glide through.

---

## 1) Narrative Requirements (make it irresistible)

### Opening Hook (must be cinematic)

Begin with a short, punchy scene that shows slang in action—an overheard line, a street corner, a text message, a jazz club whisper, a battlefield quip—then pull the reader into the mystery:

> "Where did the word 'slang' come from… and why does it feel a little rebellious?"

### Tone & Voice

- Playful, clever, vivid—never dry.
- Use occasional sharp one-liners and surprising comparisons.
- Balance charm with rigor: every major claim is sourced.

### Reader Experience

Make the reader feel they're traveling through time:
- micro-stories
- caption-led learning
- "Did you know?" sidebars
- myth-busting callouts ("Common belief vs what evidence shows")

---

## 2) Research Requirements (deep, credible, transparent)

### Primary/Authoritative Sources to Consult (minimum)

Use and cite multiple types of references, prioritizing primary/authoritative works:

- Major historical dictionaries (e.g., Oxford English Dictionary or equivalent)
- Etymology references (e.g., scholarly etymological dictionaries)
- Slang-focused scholarship (e.g., dedicated slang dictionaries and academic works)
- Corpora / usage databases where possible (e.g., historical corpora, published datasets)

### Etymology Standards (no hand-waving)

For the origin of "slang," do ALL of the following:

- Earliest attested appearances (date + context + source).
- Original meaning(s) at earliest attestations.
- Competing origin theories (if disputed): present each theory, label confidence level, and explain evidence.
- Show how meaning shifted (pejorative/neutral/proud identity marker).

Distinguish:
- the word "slang" (the term)
- slang as a phenomenon (the language behavior)

### "Receipts" Rule

Every panel/section includes:
- A short bibliography entry or footnote marker
- Image credits / licensing notes (public domain / CC / archival permission)

---

## 3) Visual Direction (photo-first, not text-first)

### Image Types to Include (curated, not random)

Use photorealistic images wherever historically possible, mixing:

- Archival photographs (streets, newspapers, print shops, classrooms, clubs)
- Manuscripts or dictionary pages (macro close-ups)
- Period ephemera (posters, pamphlets, broadsides, zines)
- Global street signage / typography textures (to represent spread)
- Modern slang mediums (text bubbles, screenshots-style compositions—redacted for privacy)

**Rule:** If a "key figure" predates photography, use high-quality engravings/portraits and label them accurately (don't pretend they're photos).

### Must-Have Visual Devices

- A timeline (beautiful, central, and easy to read)
- A map (global diffusion; arrows or heat-mapped cultural pathways)
- At least one data visualization (e.g., usage frequency over time, corpus-based trendline)
- "Word family / concept constellation" graphic:
  - slang vs argot / cant / jargon / vernacular / colloquial / patois
  - show overlaps and distinctions visually

---

## 4) Typography & Art Direction (make the word feel like itself)

### Typographic Concept

Your typography should evolve with history:

- Early attestations: classical serif / bookish texture
- Industrial print era: newspaper headline energy
- Jazz age: art deco accents
- Hip-hop / street culture: bold condensed / poster vibe
- Internet era: clean UI type + emoji/ASCII flavor (tastefully)

### Font Pairing System (required)

Choose one display face + one text face + one accent style and keep rules consistent:

- **Display:** expressive (titles)
- **Text:** highly readable (body)
- **Accent:** quotes, timestamps, dictionary entries (typewriter/mono optional)

### Layout Rules

- Prioritize negative space and legibility.
- Use pull-quotes like museum placards.
- Keep each panel to one main idea.
- Use consistent caption styling and image credit placement.

---

## 5) Content Structure (suggested panels/chapters)

### A) The Spark: What "Slang" Feels Like

- A visual montage of slang in daily life
- A crisp definition + what slang is not

### B) Birth Certificate: First Sightings

- Earliest recorded uses (quote snippets kept short)
- The original sense (and whether it was judgmental)

### C) The Mystery: Where the Word Came From

- Present competing etymologies (if applicable)
- Confidence labels: Strong / Plausible / Speculative
- Explain why some origins are uncertain (missing records, oral culture)

### D) The Social Life of Slang (why it exists)

- Belonging, secrecy, humor, speed, rebellion, identity
- Class dynamics: who gets to call it "slang" vs "language"?

### E) America's Timeline (U.S. focus—then widen)

Create a clear U.S. timeline with cultural anchors:
- print culture
- immigration and urbanization
- wartime slang
- jazz, beat, counterculture
- hip-hop
- internet/social media

Include representative slang examples per era (clearly labeled as examples, with sources).

### F) Global Spread

- English-speaking world divergences
- Borrowings, calques, local slang ecosystems
- A map showing diffusion and regional hotspots

### G) Gatekeepers & Champions (key figures)

Identify lexicographers, writers, journalists, linguists, or cultural figures who:
- popularized the term "slang,"
- documented it,
- defended it,
- or helped it spread.

For each key figure:
- Provide a portrait (photo if available; otherwise historically accurate image)
- A 1–2 sentence "why they matter"
- One cited contribution (book, article, dictionary, quote—short excerpt only)

### H) Slang Today: The Internet as a Slang Engine

- Memes, gaming, AAVE influence debates (handled respectfully)
- Acceleration, remix culture, platforms
- Slang's half-life (why words burn bright then vanish)

### I) Ending That Sticks

Close with a reflective punch:
- slang as living proof language belongs to people
- a final image that lingers (a neon sign, a crowded text thread, a dictionary page closing)

---

## 6) Ethics & Accuracy Safeguards (mandatory)

- Treat slang from marginalized communities with respect and context.
- Avoid stereotyping; explain appropriation and power dynamics carefully.
- Don't invent quotes or "first uses." If uncertain, say so transparently.
- Use only properly licensed images; include credits.

---

## 7) Production Checklist (make it "publish-ready")

Include at the end:
- Annotated bibliography (primary + secondary sources)
- Image credits (creator, date, license, archive)
- Timeline sources (where each date comes from)
- Glossary (slang, argot, cant, jargon, vernacular, register, sociolect)

---

## 8) Style Constraints (so it stays beautiful)

- No walls of text.
- Prefer short paragraphs, captions, and bold "placard lines."
- Each section must have: one striking image + one irresistible takeaway.
- Maintain a consistent visual identity across the whole piece.

---

## Optional "Delight Features" (include at least 3)

- **"Slang Court"**: a playful mock trial of whether a word is "slang" or "jargon"
- **"Then vs Now"**: same concept expressed in 3 eras
- **"Anatomy of a Dictionary Entry"**: how lexicographers capture slang
- **"Slang Speedrun"**: a rapid-fire montage of slang birth → peak → cringe → fossil
- **"Voices"**: tiny quoted reactions from different eras (clearly sourced)
