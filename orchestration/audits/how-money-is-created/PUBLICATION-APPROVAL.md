## Director Notes

This essay represents a high-quality implementation of a complex, process-driven visual essay. The content is authoritative, well-researched, and clearly explained. The technical implementation is solid, with excellent visual components and accessibility features.

The missing scroll-lock sequences are a spec requirement but do not prevent publication. They enhance the immersive experience but the essay is fully functional and valuable without them. These can be added post-publication as an enhancement.

The essay successfully achieves its goal: providing a clear, mechanical explanation of money creation without ideology or panic. It treats money as infrastructure—a system to understand, not a political argument to win.
