## Verification Philosophy

Every scientific claim in the essay must be:
1. **Verified** against peer-reviewed sources
2. **Tiered** by certainty level
3. **Simplified** without distortion

The essay avoids citations inline (per prompt), but this document provides the evidentiary backbone.

## Claim Tiers

| Tier | Meaning | Source Requirement |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Established scientific consensus | Textbook-level; multiple review articles |
| **Tier 2** | Well-supported, actively researched | Multiple peer-reviewed studies |
| **Tier 3** | Emerging/debated | Single studies or theoretical proposals |

This essay should rely **primarily on Tier 1-2 claims**.

## Core Claims

### Claim 1: The brain generates predictions before sensory input arrives

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tier** | 1 — Established consensus |
| **Plain language** | The brain guesses what will happen before signals arrive |
| **Used in** | Section 3 |

**Evidence summary**:
- Predictive coding has been demonstrated across sensory modalities (vision, audition, somatosensation)
- Top-down signals in cortex outnumber bottom-up signals
- EEG/MEG studies show prediction-related neural activity preceding stimulus

**Key sources**:
- Rao & Ballard (1999). Predictive coding in the visual cortex.
- Clark (2013). Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*.
- Friston (2010). The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory? *Nature Reviews Neuroscience*.

### Claim 2: Prediction error signals exist and drive learning

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tier** | 1 — Established consensus |
| **Plain language** | When reality differs from prediction, the brain generates a "surprise" signal |
| **Used in** | Section 4 |

**Evidence summary**:
- Dopamine neurons encode reward prediction error (foundational finding)
- Sensory cortices show enhanced response to unexpected stimuli
- Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a well-documented prediction error signal

**Key sources**:
- Schultz et al. (1997). A neural substrate of prediction and reward. *Science*.
- Näätänen et al. (2007). The mismatch negativity. *Clinical Neurophysiology*.
- den Ouden et al. (2012). How prediction errors shape perception, attention, and motivation. *Frontiers in Psychology*.

### Claim 3: Perception is an inference, not a direct readout

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tier** | 1 — Established consensus |
| **Plain language** | What we experience is the brain's best guess, not raw reality |
| **Used in** | Section 5 |

**Evidence summary**:
- Optical illusions demonstrate perception ≠ reality
- Perceptual filling-in (blind spot) shows brain constructs experience
- Bistable perception shows brain can interpret same input differently

**Key sources**:
- Helmholtz (1867). Treatise on Physiological Optics. (foundational)
- Gregory (1980). Perceptions as hypotheses. *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society*.
- Kersten et al. (2004). Object perception as Bayesian inference. *Annual Review of Psychology*.

### Claim 4: Prediction is more metabolically efficient than reaction

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tier** | 2 — Well-supported |
| **Plain language** | Predicting correctly uses less energy than processing everything fresh |
| **Used in** | Section 6 |

**Evidence summary**:
- Brain consumes ~20% of body's energy despite being ~2% of mass
- Predictive coding minimizes information that needs to be transmitted
- Expected stimuli produce smaller neural responses than unexpected

**Key sources**:
- Raichle & Gusnard (2002). Appraising the brain's energy budget. *PNAS*.
- Friston (2010). The free-energy principle (energy minimization framing).
- Summerfield & de Lange (2014). Expectation in perceptual decision making. *Nature Reviews Neuroscience*.

---

### Claim 5: Attention can be understood as precision weighting of prediction errors

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tier** | 2 — Well-supported, active research |
| **Plain language** | Attention makes certain prediction errors "louder" than others |
| **Used in** | Section 7 |

**Evidence summary**:
- Attention enhances neural responses to attended stimuli
- Predictive coding models treat attention as gain control on error units
- Attention and expectation interact in measurable ways

**Key sources**:
- Feldman & Friston (2010). Attention, uncertainty, and free-energy. *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience*.
- Kok et al. (2012). Less is more: Expectation sharpens representations in the primary visual cortex. *Neuron*.

### Claim 6: Learning updates the brain's predictive model

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tier** | 1 — Established consensus |
| **Plain language** | Learning is the process of making better predictions |
| **Used in** | Section 7 |

**Evidence summary**:
- Synaptic plasticity (Hebbian learning) supports model updating
- Prediction error drives dopaminergic learning signals
- Statistical learning demonstrates implicit model formation

**Key sources**:
- Rescorla & Wagner (1972). A theory of Pavlovian conditioning. (prediction error in learning)
- Saffran et al. (1996). Statistical learning by 8-month-old infants. *Science*.
- Schultz (2016). Dopamine reward prediction error signalling. *Nature Reviews Neuroscience*.

## Claims to Avoid

| Claim | Why Avoid |
|-------|-----------|
| Brain uses Bayesian inference | Mathematically accurate but jargon (prompt forbids "Bayesian") |
| Free energy principle explains brain | Too theoretical for audience |
| Specific brain regions do X | Would require anatomy lesson |
| Brain is like a neural network (AI) | Explicitly forbidden |

---

## Simplification Guidelines

| Scientific Version | Essay Version | Distortion Check |
|--------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Prediction error minimization | "The brain tries to make better predictions" | ✓ Accurate |
| Precision-weighted prediction error | "Attention makes some surprises louder" | ✓ Accurate |
| Hierarchical predictive coding | "The brain has a model" | ✓ Simplified but not wrong |
| Bayesian inference | OMIT | N/A (forbidden term) |
