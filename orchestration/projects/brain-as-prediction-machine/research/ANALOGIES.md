## Analogy Philosophy

The prompt specifies:
> "Use simple metaphors ONLY when they truly clarify (not for flair)"

Analogies should:
1. Illuminate the target concept without introducing new confusion
2. Have documented **limitations** (where the analogy breaks)
3. Be **reused** rather than introducing many different analogies

---

## Primary Analogy: Autocomplete

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Source domain** | Phone/computer text prediction |
| **Target concept** | Brain's predictive processing |
| **Strength** | Almost everyone has used autocomplete |

### Mapping

| Autocomplete | Brain |
|--------------|-------|
| Keyboard predictions | Neural predictions |
| You type, it guesses | World happens, brain guesses |
| Wrong suggestion → you correct | Prediction error → model update |
| System learns your patterns | Brain learns from experience |
| Suggestions based on history | Predictions based on prior experience |

### Example Usage

> "Your brain works like autocomplete. Before you even finish typing, your phone guesses what you're going to say next. Similarly, before sensory signals even arrive, your brain generates a guess about what they'll be."

### Limitations (where analogy breaks)

| Limitation | Truth |
|------------|-------|
| Autocomplete is conscious/visible | Brain predictions are unconscious |
| You can reject autocomplete suggestions | You can't reject brain predictions |
| Autocomplete only does language | Brain predicts everything |
| Autocomplete errors are annoying | Brain errors drive learning |

**When to acknowledge limitation**: Section 3, when introducing unconscious nature of prediction.

## Secondary Analogy: GPS Navigation

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Source domain** | GPS route prediction |
| **Target concept** | Prediction + error correction |
| **Use sparingly** | Only if autocomplete doesn't land |

### Mapping

| GPS | Brain |
|-----|-------|
| Predicted route | Expected sensory input |
| You take wrong turn | Reality differs from prediction |
| "Recalculating" | Prediction error → model update |
| New route generated | Updated prediction |

### Example Usage

> "When you take a wrong turn, your GPS doesn't panic — it recalculates. Your brain does the same thing: when reality doesn't match prediction, it updates its model and generates a new prediction."

### Limitations

| Limitation | Truth |
|------------|-------|
| GPS responds to single events | Brain is continuously predicting |
| GPS has external map | Brain builds its own map |
| GPS recalculation is slow | Brain updates are fast |

## Running Example: Catching a Ball

The prompt suggests using **one consistent everyday scenario** to anchor multiple sections.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Scenario** | Someone throws a ball and you catch it |
| **Why this works** | Familiar, physical, timing-dependent |
| **Reuse across** | Sections 2, 3, 4, 6 |

### Section 2 Application (Latency Problem)

> "Someone throws a ball at you. If your brain waited for the ball to hit your hand before responding, you'd never catch it. The reaction would come too late."

### Section 3 Application (Prediction Introduced)

> "So how do you catch the ball? Your brain predicts where the ball will be — based on its trajectory — and moves your hand to that spot before the ball arrives."

### Section 4 Application (Prediction Error)

> "But what if the ball curves unexpectedly? You miss. That miss generates a prediction error, and your brain updates its model of how balls move through air."

### Section 6 Application (Efficiency)

> "When you catch a ball successfully, your brain didn't have to work hard — the prediction was right. It only expends significant energy when it's surprised, when it needs to learn something new."

## Analogy to Avoid

| Analogy | Why Avoid |
|---------|-----------|
| Computer/processor | Implies brain is hardware; too mechanical |
| AI/neural network | Explicitly forbidden in prompt |
| Camera | Reinforces naive "receiver" model |
| Mirror | Implies passive reflection |
| Tape recorder | Implies passive storage |

---

## Metaphor Glossary

| Metaphor | Used For | First Appears |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| "Autocomplete for reality" | Prediction | Section 3 |
| "Surprise signal" | Prediction error | Section 4 |
| "Your brain's best guess" | Perception | Section 5 |
| "Volume knob for surprise" | Attention | Section 7 |
