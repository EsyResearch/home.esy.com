## Definition Philosophy

All definitions must be:
1. **Pre-introduced** — Term is defined BEFORE it's used
2. **Plain language** — No jargon in definitions
3. **Short** — One sentence preferred, two maximum
4. **Example-grounded** — Where possible, connect to the running example

## Required Terms (in order of appearance)

### Tier 1: Must Define Explicitly (high cognitive load terms)

| Term | Definition | First Appears |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Prediction** | The brain's automatically generated guess about what will happen next | Section 3 |
| **Prediction error** | The difference between what the brain expected and what actually happened | Section 4 |
| **Model updating** | The brain's process of adjusting its predictions based on new information | Section 4 |
| **Controlled hallucination** | The idea that what we perceive is the brain's best guess, not a direct copy of the world | Section 5 |

### Tier 2: Define Briefly (medium cognitive load terms)

| Term | Definition | First Appears |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Sensory input** | Raw signals from the world arriving through your senses | Section 2 |
| **Top-down** | Information flowing from the brain's internal model outward | Section 3 |
| **Bottom-up** | Information flowing from the senses inward | Section 3 |
| **Latency** | The time delay between an event and the brain's response to it | Section 2 |

### Tier 3: Use Without Formal Definition (assumed understood)

| Term | Why no definition needed |
|------|-------------------------|
| Brain | Universally understood |
| Senses | Universally understood |
| Learning | Common usage, refined in context |
| Attention | Common usage, refined in context |
| Mistake | Common usage, reframed in context |

## Expanded Definitions (for reference)

### Prediction

**Simple**: The brain's guess about what's coming next.

**Expanded**: Before sensory signals even arrive, the brain generates an internal guess about what those signals will be. This happens automatically, below conscious awareness, based on everything the brain has learned before.

**Common confusion**: Prediction doesn't mean "conscious forecasting" — you don't sit and think "I predict X." It happens automatically, thousands of times per second.

---

### Prediction Error

**Simple**: The surprise signal when reality doesn't match expectation.

**Expanded**: When sensory input arrives and differs from what the brain predicted, the mismatch generates a signal called prediction error. This signal is not a failure notification — it's information that helps the brain improve its model.

**Common confusion**: "Error" sounds negative, but prediction error is essential. Without it, the brain cannot learn.

---

### Model Updating

**Simple**: Editing the brain's internal autocomplete.

**Expanded**: When prediction error occurs, the brain adjusts its internal model — the set of patterns it uses to generate predictions. Small errors lead to small adjustments; large errors can trigger significant model changes.

**Common confusion**: This is not conscious. You don't choose to update your model. It happens automatically.

---

### Controlled Hallucination

**Simple**: Perception is a best guess, constrained by evidence.

**Expanded**: What you consciously experience (sights, sounds, feelings) is not a direct window into the world. It's the brain's internal model — a kind of hallucination — but one that is constrained and corrected by sensory evidence. The "controlled" part means reality keeps it in check.

**Common confusion**: "Hallucination" sounds pathological. Here it's used technically to mean "internally generated experience." The word emphasizes that perception is constructed, not received.

**Handle with care**: This term can be unsettling. Frame it carefully: "This doesn't mean you're disconnected from reality. It means your experience of reality is built by your brain, checked against reality."

## Terms to Avoid (per prompt constraints)

| Forbidden Term | Why | Alternative |
|----------------|-----|-------------|
| Bayesian | Mathematical jargon | "The brain updates based on evidence" |
| Prior | Technical term | "What the brain expects before seeing evidence" |
| Posterior | Technical term | "What the brain concludes after seeing evidence" |
| Free energy | Too abstract | Omit entirely |
| Inference | Can be kept if defined simply | "The brain's process of making its best guess" |
| Neural network | AI connotation | Omit entirely |
| Computational | Too technical | "How the brain processes" |

*These definitions ensure every key term is understood before it carries weight in the argument.*
