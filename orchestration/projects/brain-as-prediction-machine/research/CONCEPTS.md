## Primary Concept: Predictive Processing

The brain's fundamental operating principle is prediction, not reaction. The brain continuously generates models of what will happen next and compares these predictions against incoming sensory data.

### Concept Hierarchy

```
PREDICTIVE PROCESSING (master concept)
├── Prediction (internal model output)
│   ├── Top-down signals
│   └── Prior expectations
├── Sensory Input (bottom-up signals)
│   ├── Raw sensory data
│   └── "Evidence" for or against prediction
├── Prediction Error (comparison result)
│   ├── Mismatch detection
│   └── Learning signal
└── Model Updating (response to error)
    ├── Short-term adjustment
    └── Long-term learning
```

## Core Concepts (7 Required)

### 1. Prediction

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Definition** | The brain's internally generated best guess about what sensory input will arrive next |
| **Metaphor** | Auto-complete for reality |
| **Prerequisite** | None (entry concept) |
| **Leads to** | Prediction Error |
| **Diagram role** | Rounded rectangle (brain model) |

**Key insight**: Predictions are not conscious guesses. They happen automatically, below awareness, thousands of times per second.

---

### 2. Sensory Input

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Definition** | Raw data from the world arriving through senses |
| **Metaphor** | Reality check / incoming signal |
| **Prerequisite** | None (entry concept) |
| **Leads to** | Comparison with Prediction |
| **Diagram role** | Circle (input) |

**Key insight**: Sensory input is not "truth" — it's noisy, incomplete, and ambiguous. The brain must interpret it.

---

### 3. Prediction Error

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Definition** | The difference between what the brain predicted and what sensory input actually reported |
| **Metaphor** | A surprise signal / the "you were wrong" alert |
| **Prerequisite** | Prediction + Sensory Input |
| **Leads to** | Model Updating |
| **Diagram role** | ACCENT COLOR (this is the only concept that gets the accent) |

**Key insight**: Prediction error is not failure — it's the engine of learning. Without it, the brain cannot improve.

---

### 4. Model Updating

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Definition** | The process of adjusting internal predictions based on prediction error |
| **Metaphor** | Editing your internal autocomplete dictionary |
| **Prerequisite** | Prediction Error |
| **Leads to** | Better Predictions (loop) |
| **Diagram role** | Rectangle (process) with loop arrow |

**Key insight**: The brain is not trying to "see reality" — it's trying to minimize prediction error by building better models.

---

### 5. Perception (as inference)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Definition** | What we consciously experience; the brain's best guess constrained by sensory evidence |
| **Metaphor** | Controlled hallucination (careful: explain this term) |
| **Prerequisite** | Prediction, Sensory Input, Prediction Error |
| **Leads to** | Understanding of attention |
| **Diagram role** | Output circle |

**Key insight**: We do not perceive the world directly. We perceive our brain's best model of the world.

---

### 6. Attention (as precision weighting)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Definition** | The brain's mechanism for deciding which prediction errors matter most |
| **Metaphor** | A volume knob for surprise signals |
| **Prerequisite** | Prediction Error |
| **Leads to** | Practical applications |
| **Diagram role** | Thicker outline (visual emphasis) |

**Key insight**: Attention doesn't let us "see more" — it makes certain prediction errors louder than others.

---

### 7. Learning (as model refinement)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Definition** | The long-term accumulation of model updates that improve prediction accuracy |
| **Metaphor** | Training your brain's autocomplete system |
| **Prerequisite** | Prediction Error + Model Updating |
| **Leads to** | Final mental model |
| **Diagram role** | Loop arrow (continuous cycle) |

**Key insight**: Learning is not "absorbing information" — it's reducing prediction error through repeated exposure.

## Concept Dependencies (Teaching Order)

| Order | Concept | Why this order |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Sensory Input | Familiar to everyone; starts with intuition |
| 2 | Traditional view (reaction) | Set up the misconception before correcting it |
| 3 | Prediction | Introduce the core thesis |
| 4 | Prediction Error | Natural question: "What happens when wrong?" |
| 5 | Model Updating | Complete the loop |
| 6 | Perception | Apply framework: what we "see" is a model |
| 7 | Attention | Apply framework: attention as precision |
| 8 | Learning | Apply framework: learning as error reduction |

---

## Anti-Concepts (Explicitly Exclude)

| Concept | Why Exclude |
|---------|-------------|
| Bayesian inference | Mathematical; violates "no equations" rule |
| Free energy principle | Too technical for audience |
| Brain regions | Would turn into anatomy lesson |
| Neural networks (AI) | Explicitly forbidden in prompt |
| Computational neuroscience | Jargon-heavy field |
