# G7.5 Scroll Certification: The Brain as a Prediction Machine

**Date**: February 3, 2026  
**Auditor**: Scrolling Auditor  
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

---

## Audit Overview

This audit verifies scroll behavior and animation implementation:
1. Scroll-based animations work correctly
2. Intersection Observer triggers are appropriate
3. Progress indicators function correctly
4. No scroll hijacking or accessibility issues

---

## Animation Implementation Audit

### Intersection Observer Usage

| Component | Trigger Threshold | Behavior | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| Section visibility | 0.15 | Fade in + translate | ✅ |
| Diagram animations | 0.15 | Element animations | ✅ |
| Reading progress | scroll event | Width percentage | ✅ |

**Assessment**: ✅ Intersection Observer is used appropriately with reasonable thresholds.

---

### Diagram Animation Timing

| Diagram | Animation Type | Duration | Stagger | Status |
|---------|---------------|----------|---------|--------|
| 1. Naive Model | Fade in | 400ms | 200ms between elements | ✅ |
| 2. Latency | Fade in | 400ms | 200ms between elements | ✅ |
| 3. Prediction Loop | Fade in | 400ms | 100-200ms stagger | ✅ |
| 4. Error Comparison | Fade + scale | 400ms | 100-200ms stagger | ✅ |
| 5. Perception | Fade in | 400ms | 100ms stagger | ✅ |
| 6. Efficiency | Fade in | 400ms | 200ms stagger | ✅ |
| 7. Applications | Fade in | 400ms | 100ms stagger | ✅ |
| 8. Complete Loop | Fade in | 400ms | 100ms stagger | ✅ |

**Assessment**: ✅ Animation timings are consistent and appropriate for comprehension.

## Reading Progress Bar

| Feature | Implemented? | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Fixed at top | ✅ | z-index: 101 |
| Smooth width transition | ✅ | 100ms linear |
| Full document tracking | ✅ | scrollY / (scrollHeight - innerHeight) |
| Capped at 100% | ✅ | Math.min(progress, 100) |

**Assessment**: ✅ Reading progress bar functions correctly.

---

## Header Scroll Behavior

| Feature | Implemented? | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Transparent initially | ✅ | background: transparent |
| Background on scroll | ✅ | Appears after 100px |
| Blur backdrop | ✅ | backdrop-filter: blur(8px) |
| Shadow on scroll | ✅ | box-shadow added |

**Assessment**: ✅ Header scroll behavior is smooth and non-jarring.

---

## Scroll Hijacking Check

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is scroll hijacked at any point? | ❌ No |
| Is body overflow ever locked? | ❌ No |
| Are wheel events intercepted? | ❌ No |
| Is native scroll behavior preserved? | ✅ Yes |

**Assessment**: ✅ No scroll hijacking. Native scroll is preserved throughout.

**Note**: This essay does NOT use scroll-lock sections (unlike etymology essays). All animations are triggered via Intersection Observer, allowing normal scrolling.

## Mobile Behavior

| Feature | Desktop | Mobile | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Animations | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ |
| Reading progress | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Section visibility | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Touch scrolling | N/A | ✅ Native | ✅ |

**Assessment**: ✅ Mobile behavior is consistent with desktop.

---

## Performance Check

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Passive scroll listeners | ✅ `{ passive: true }` |
| Debounced scroll handling | ✅ No heavy computation in scroll |
| Will-change hints | ✅ Applied to animated elements |
| No layout thrashing | ✅ No offsetHeight reads in scroll |

**Assessment**: ✅ Scroll performance is optimized.

---

## Reduced Motion Support

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` | ✅ Implemented |
| Animations disabled | ✅ `animation: none` |
| Transitions disabled | ✅ `transition: none` |
| Content visible without animation | ✅ `opacity: 1` default |

**Assessment**: ✅ Reduced motion support is complete.

---

## Issues Found

**None.**

---

- Scroll-based animations work correctly via Intersection Observer
- No scroll hijacking or accessibility issues
- Reading progress bar functions correctly
- Header scroll behavior is smooth
