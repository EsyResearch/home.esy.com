# G9 Publication Approval: The Brain as a Prediction Machine

**Date**: February 3, 2026  
**Approver**: Project Owner  
**Status**: ✅ APPROVED (with design iteration noted)

---

## Approval Decision

**APPROVED FOR PUBLICATION**

---

## Approval Notes

### Design Feedback

> "Design needs work, doesn't really give the Neuroscience theme"

**Action Item**: Schedule design iteration to strengthen neuroscience visual identity.

Potential areas to explore:
- [ ] Neural/synaptic visual motifs in background
- [ ] More biologically-inspired color derivation
- [ ] Diagram styling that evokes neural networks/pathways
- [ ] Typography that feels more scientific/medical
- [ ] Subtle texture or patterns suggesting brain tissue/neurons

**Priority**: Low (post-publication iteration)
