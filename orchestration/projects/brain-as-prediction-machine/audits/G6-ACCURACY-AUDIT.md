**Status**: ✅ PASSED

---

## Audit Overview

This audit verifies that all scientific claims in the essay are:
1. Accurately represented from `CLAIMS.md`
2. Not distorted through simplification
3. Appropriately tiered (no Tier 3 speculation presented as fact)

## Claim-by-Claim Verification

### Claim 1: Brain generates predictions before sensory input arrives

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **CLAIMS.md Tier** | Tier 1 — Established consensus |
| **Used in Section** | 3 (The Predictive Brain) |
| **Essay Statement** | "Instead of waiting to react, the brain is constantly generating predictions about what will happen next" |
| **Accuracy Check** | ✅ ACCURATE |

**Verification Notes**:
- Statement aligns with CLAIMS.md source (Rao & Ballard 1999, Clark 2013)
- "Constantly" is appropriate — predictive coding is continuous
- No overstatement detected

---

### Claim 2: Prediction error signals exist and drive learning

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **CLAIMS.md Tier** | Tier 1 — Established consensus |
| **Used in Section** | 4 (Prediction Error) |
| **Essay Statement** | "When a prediction is wrong, the brain doesn't just ignore the mistake — it generates a prediction error signal" |
| **Accuracy Check** | ✅ ACCURATE |

**Verification Notes**:
- Statement aligns with CLAIMS.md (Schultz et al. 1997, Näätänen et al. 2007)
- "Signal" is accurate terminology
- Framing as "update needed" alert is appropriate simplification

---

### Claim 3: Perception is an inference, not a direct readout

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **CLAIMS.md Tier** | Tier 1 — Established consensus |
| **Used in Section** | 5 (Controlled Hallucination) |
| **Essay Statement** | "What you consciously experience isn't the raw world. It's your brain's best guess about the world." |
| **Accuracy Check** | ✅ ACCURATE |

**Verification Notes**:
- Statement aligns with CLAIMS.md (Helmholtz 1867, Gregory 1980, Kersten et al. 2004)
- "Best guess constrained by sensory evidence" correctly captures inference
- "Controlled hallucination" term used carefully with explanation

**Sensitive Framing Check**:
- ✅ Essay includes: "This doesn't mean you're disconnected from reality"
- ✅ Essay explains: "The guess is usually very good — that's why it feels like direct perception"
- Appropriate caution applied to potentially unsettling concept

---

### Claim 4: Prediction is more metabolically efficient than reaction

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **CLAIMS.md Tier** | Tier 2 — Well-supported |
| **Used in Section** | 6 (Efficiency) |
| **Essay Statement** | "Prediction is efficient because when the brain is right, it doesn't need to do much. It only expends energy when it's wrong" |
| **Accuracy Check** | ✅ ACCURATE |

**Verification Notes**:
- Statement aligns with CLAIMS.md (Raichle & Gusnard 2002, Friston 2010)
- Tier 2 claim presented with appropriate confidence (not overstatement)
- 20% energy statistic is accurate and sourced

---

### Claim 5: Attention can be understood as precision weighting

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **CLAIMS.md Tier** | Tier 2 — Well-supported, active research |
| **Used in Section** | 7 (Applications) |
| **Essay Statement** | "Attention isn't about seeing more — it's about making certain prediction errors louder than others" |
| **Accuracy Check** | ✅ ACCURATE |

**Verification Notes**:
- Statement aligns with CLAIMS.md (Feldman & Friston 2010, Kok et al. 2012)
- "Louder" is appropriate metaphor for "precision weighting"
- Tier 2 claim, appropriately qualified in context

---

### Claim 6: Learning updates the brain's predictive model

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **CLAIMS.md Tier** | Tier 1 — Established consensus |
| **Used in Section** | 7 (Applications) |
| **Essay Statement** | "Learning is not absorbing facts — it's updating your brain's predictions through exposure" |
| **Accuracy Check** | ✅ ACCURATE |

**Verification Notes**:
- Statement aligns with CLAIMS.md (Rescorla & Wagner 1972, Saffran et al. 1996)
- Framing of "updating predictions" is accurate to predictive coding
- Contrast with "absorbing facts" is pedagogically useful, not distortive

## Forbidden Content Check

| Forbidden Element | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| AI/machine learning mentions | ✅ ABSENT |
| "Bayesian" terminology | ✅ ABSENT |
| "Free energy principle" | ✅ ABSENT |
| Brain region name-dropping | ✅ ABSENT |
| Academic citations in text | ✅ ABSENT |
| Mathematical notation | ✅ ABSENT |

---

## Tier Distribution Check

| Tier | Claims | Percentage | Limit |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Tier 1 | 4 | 67% | No limit |
| Tier 2 | 2 | 33% | OK |
| Tier 3 | 0 | 0% | ✅ Good (minimize) |

**Assessment**: Claim distribution is appropriate. No speculative claims (Tier 3) are presented.

---

## Simplification Audit

| Simplification | Accurate? | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|-------|
| "Autocomplete for reality" | ✅ | Metaphor is clarifying, not distortive |
| "Prediction error is the engine of learning" | ✅ | Accurate framing |
| "Controlled hallucination" | ✅ | Explained carefully with "controlled" emphasis |
| "Brain's best guess" | ✅ | Accurate to inference framework |
| Catching ball example | ✅ | Valid illustration of prediction timing |
