| **Three applications covered** | ✅ Learning, Attention, Mistakes |
| **Diagram support** | ✅ Applications Diagram (hierarchy) |
| **Verdict** | ✅ OBJECTIVE MET |

---

## Prerequisite Chain Verification

The essay must introduce concepts before they are used:

| Concept | First Introduced | First Used | Chain Valid? |
|---------|------------------|------------|--------------|
| Sensory Input | Section 1 | Section 1 | ✅ |
| Naive Model | Section 1 | Section 2 | ✅ |
| Latency Problem | Section 2 | Section 3 | ✅ |
| Prediction | Section 3 | Section 4 | ✅ |
| Comparison | Section 3 | Section 4 | ✅ |
| Prediction Error | Section 4 | Section 5 | ✅ |
| Model Updating | Section 4 | Section 6 | ✅ |
| Perception | Section 5 | Section 7 | ✅ |
| Efficiency | Section 6 | Section 7 | ✅ |

**Chain Assessment**: ✅ No concept is used before it is introduced.

---

## Cognitive Load Management

| Section | New Concepts | SEQUENCE.md Complexity | Implemented Mitigation | Status |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| 1 | 1 | Low | None needed | ✅ |
| 2 | 2 | Medium | Running example (ball) | ✅ |
| 3 | 2 | High | Same running example | ✅ |
| 4 | 2 | High | Same running example | ✅ |
| 5 | 1 | High | Short section, strong diagram | ✅ |
| 6 | 1 | Medium | Practical grounding | ✅ |
| 7 | 3 | High | Bullet format, quick transfer | ✅ |
| 8 | 0 | Low | Consolidation only | ✅ |

**Cognitive Load Assessment**: ✅ Mitigation strategies from SEQUENCE.md are implemented.

---

## Misconception Addressing

### Misconception 1: "The brain reacts to the world"

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Method** | Misconception-first (Sections 1-3) |
| **Explicit contrast** | ✅ Misconception block present |
| **Diagram contrast** | ✅ Naive Model vs. Prediction Loop |
| **Verdict** | ✅ EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED |

---

### Misconception 2: "Perception equals reality"

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Method** | Gentle reframe (Section 5) |
| **Sensitive framing** | ✅ "This doesn't mean you're disconnected" |
| **Diagram support** | ✅ Fuzzy input → clean perception |
| **Verdict** | ✅ EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED |

---

### Misconception 3: "Mistakes are failures"

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Method** | Practical reframe (Section 7) |
| **Key sentence** | ✅ "Mistakes are not failures — they're learning signals" |
| **Diagram support** | ✅ Applications diagram |
| **Verdict** | ✅ EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED |

---

### Misconception 4: "Attention is seeing more"

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Method** | Brief correction (Section 7) |
| **Key sentence** | ✅ "Attention isn't about seeing more — it's about making certain prediction errors louder" |
| **Verdict** | ✅ EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED |

---

### Misconception 5: "Learning is absorbing information"

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Method** | Practical reframe (Section 7) |
| **Key sentence** | ✅ "Learning is not absorbing facts — it's updating your brain's predictions" |
| **Verdict** | ✅ EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED |

---

## Analogy Effectiveness

### Primary Analogy: Autocomplete

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Source domain familiar?** | ✅ Phone autocomplete is universal |
| **Mapping clear?** | ✅ Keyboard → Neural, Guess → Prediction |
| **Limitations acknowledged?** | ✅ In ANALOGIES.md (essay acknowledges unconscious nature) |
| **Reused effectively?** | ✅ Referenced in Section 3, implicit throughout |
| **Verdict** | ✅ EFFECTIVE |

---

### Running Example: Catching a Ball

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Used in sections** | 2, 3, 4, 6 (as specified) |
| **Consistent scenario** | ✅ Same ball-catching throughout |
| **Builds understanding** | ✅ Latency → Prediction → Error → Efficiency |
| **Verdict** | ✅ EFFECTIVE |

---

## Definition Clarity

| Term | Defined Before Use? | Definition Accessible? |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Prediction | ✅ Section 3 | ✅ Plain language |
| Prediction Error | ✅ Section 4 | ✅ Plain language |
| Controlled Hallucination | ✅ Section 5 | ✅ With safety framing |

---

## Issues Found

**Minor observation** (not blocking):
- Section 7 introduces three concepts rapidly. This is mitigated by bullet format but could benefit from slightly more spacing.

**Recommendation**: Consider adding a brief transition sentence between the three applications. Not blocking for approval.

---

## G6.5 Verdict

**PEDAGOGY AUDIT: ✅ PASSED**

The essay effectively teaches the target audience:
- All 4 learning objectives are met
- Prerequisite chain is valid (no concept used before introduction)
- Cognitive load is managed per SEQUENCE.md
- All 5 misconceptions are addressed
- Analogies are effective and limitations acknowledged
