## Core Thesis

**The brain is not primarily reacting to the world — it is constantly predicting it, and updating itself when it is wrong.**

## Key Research Findings (G2 Summary)

### Concepts (7 Core)
1. Prediction
2. Sensory Input
3. Prediction Error
4. Model Updating
5. Perception (as inference)
6. Attention (as precision weighting)
7. Learning (as model refinement)

### Primary Analogy
**Autocomplete for reality** — reused across sections

### Running Example
**Catching a ball** — anchors sections 2, 3, 4, 6

### Primary Misconception
"Brain reacts to world" → Corrected to "Brain predicts world"

### Key Claims (All Tier 1-2)
- Brain generates predictions before input arrives (Tier 1)
- Prediction error signals exist and drive learning (Tier 1)
- Perception is inference, not direct readout (Tier 1)
- Prediction is metabolically efficient (Tier 2)
- Attention is precision weighting (Tier 2)

## Next Steps

1. **G3**: Create 6-layer invocation spec using Conceptual Essay Skill
2. **G4**: Design Research (Pedagogical Lens) for diagram system
3. **G5**: Content implementation
