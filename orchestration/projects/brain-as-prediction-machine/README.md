## Core Thesis

**The brain is not primarily reacting to the world — it is constantly predicting it, and updating itself when it is wrong.**

## Key Research Findings (G2 Summary)

### Concepts (7 Core)
1. Prediction
2. Sensory Input
3. Prediction Error
4. Model Updating
5. Perception (as inference)
6. Attention (as precision weighting)
7. Learning (as model refinement)

### Primary Analogy
**Autocomplete for reality** — reused across sections

### Running Example
**Catching a ball** — anchors sections 2, 3, 4, 6

### Primary Misconception
"Brain reacts to world" → Corrected to "Brain predicts world"

### Key Claims (All Tier 1-2)
- Brain generates predictions before input arrives (Tier 1)
- Prediction error signals exist and drive learning (Tier 1)
- Perception is inference, not direct readout (Tier 1)
- Prediction is metabolically efficient (Tier 2)
- Attention is precision weighting (Tier 2)

## Design Research Summary (G4)

### Color Tokens
| Token | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `--diagram-primary` | #4A90D9 | Brain model, predictions |
| `--diagram-secondary` | #718096 | World, sensory input |
| `--diagram-accent` | #E53E3E | Prediction error ONLY |

### Typography
- **Display**: Space Grotesk
- **Body**: Inter

### Key Design Decisions
- **Accent color constraint**: #E53E3E used ONLY for prediction error
- **8 SVG diagrams** with scroll-lock animations
- **Pedagogical color system** — comprehension over decoration
- **No brain imagery** — abstract process diagrams only

## Next Steps

1. ~~**G3**: Create 6-layer invocation spec using Conceptual Essay Skill~~ ✅
2. ~~**G4**: Design Research (Pedagogical Lens)~~ ✅
3. **G5**: Content Implementation — Build the essay using:
   - Spec: `specs/brain-as-prediction-machine.md`
   - Design: `DESIGN-RESEARCH.md`
   - Research: `research/*.md`
4. **G6-G7**: Quality audits (Accuracy, Pedagogy, Diagram Clarity)
5. **G8-G9**: Publication certification and approval
