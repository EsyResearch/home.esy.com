## Exploratory Questions

1. How has the understanding of money creation evolved historically?
2. What are the differences between money creation systems across major economies (US, EU, UK)?
3. How do digital currencies and CBDCs relate to traditional money creation?
4. What role does trust play in the monetary system?
5. How do expectations affect money creation and circulation?

## Hypotheses

### Strong Hypotheses (High Confidence)
1. **IF** modern money is created through credit **THEN** the "printing money" explanation is incomplete **BECAUSE** most money is created by commercial banks through lending, not central bank printing.
2. **IF** loans create deposits **THEN** banks don't lend existing deposits first **BECAUSE** the loan itself creates the deposit on the bank's balance sheet.
3. **IF** money creation is distributed **THEN** central banks influence but don't directly create most money **BECAUSE** commercial banks create money through their lending decisions.

### Working Hypotheses (Moderate Confidence)
1. **IF** money creation is constrained by confidence and regulation **THEN** capital requirements and risk assessment limit money creation **BECAUSE** banks must maintain capital ratios and assess borrower risk.
2. **IF** inflation is a system outcome **THEN** it results from imbalances between supply and demand **BECAUSE** money creation alone doesn't cause inflation without corresponding supply constraints or demand increases.
3. **IF** quantitative easing changes where money flows **THEN** it inflates assets before wages **BECAUSE** QE increases bank reserves and asset purchases before it affects broader economic activity.

### Speculative Hypotheses (Low Confidence, Worth Exploring)
1. **IF** money velocity matters **THEN** newly created money must circulate to have real economic impact **BECAUSE** money that sits idle doesn't affect prices or economic activity.
2. **IF** government spending injects money differently than banks **THEN** it may have different effects on money creation and circulation **BECAUSE** government spending doesn't require loan repayment in the same way.
