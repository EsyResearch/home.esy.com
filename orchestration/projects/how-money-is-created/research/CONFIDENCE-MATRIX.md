1. **Prioritize HIGH Confidence Claims**: Focus on claims with strong evidence (15 claims)
2. **Frame MEDIUM Confidence Claims Carefully**: Acknowledge nuance or variation where appropriate
3. **Minimize LOW Confidence Claims**: Only 1 low-confidence claim—consider reframing or removing
4. **Use Source Citations**: All claims should reference specific sources from CITATIONS.md
5. **Acknowledge Limitations**: Where confidence is MEDIUM, acknowledge variation or context-dependence
