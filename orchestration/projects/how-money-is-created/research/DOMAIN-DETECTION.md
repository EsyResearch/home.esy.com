# Phase 0: Domain Detection

**Date**: December 2025  
**Topic**: How Money Is Created

---

## Domain Signal Analysis

**Topic Keywords**: "money creation", "credit", "central bank", "commercial banks", "quantitative easing", "monetary policy", "economics", "banking system"

**Detected Domains**:

### Primary Domain: **Economics/Policy**
- **Signals**: Monetary policy, central banking, credit creation, quantitative easing, regulatory frameworks
- **Methodology Lens**: Economic theory, institutional analysis, policy documentation
- **Source Types**: Central bank publications, economics textbooks, academic papers, BIS publications
- **Expert Routing**: May benefit from economic historian consultation (if historical evolution is covered)

### Secondary Domain: **History** (if covering evolution)
- **Signals**: Historical development of money creation, evolution of banking systems, policy changes over time
- **Methodology Lens**: Primary/secondary distinction, historiographic context
- **Source Types**: Historical policy documents, economic history sources
- **Expert Routing**: Historian Writer/Editor for historical methodology

### Domain Stacking Decision

**Recommended**: **Economics/Policy** (Primary) + **History** (Secondary, if evolution is covered)

**Rationale**:
- The essay is primarily about **current mechanics** of money creation (Economics/Policy)
- However, understanding the **evolution** of these systems may require historical context (History)
- The intake document emphasizes "modern money creation" but may reference historical development

## Domain Confirmation

**Detected Domains**: Economics/Policy (Primary) + History (Secondary, conditional)

**User Confirmation**: ✅ **Confirmed** (based on intake document emphasis on modern mechanics with potential historical context)

**Applied Lenses**:
1. **Economics/Policy Lens**: 
   - Focus on institutional sources (Fed, ECB, Bank of England, BIS)
   - Economic theory and policy documentation
   - Academic economics research
   - Regulatory framework analysis

2. **History Lens** (Conditional):
   - Applied only if research reveals need for historical evolution context
   - Historical policy documents
   - Economic history sources

## Methodology Application

### Economics/Policy Methodology
- **Source Priority**: Tier 1-2 institutional sources (central banks, BIS, academic economics)
- **Evidence Standards**: Policy documents, peer-reviewed economics research, official publications
- **Expert Consultation**: Economic historians (if historical dimension needed)

### History Methodology (Conditional)
- **Source Priority**: Primary policy documents, economic history sources
- **Evidence Standards**: Historical accuracy, context verification
- **Expert Consultation**: Historian Writer/Editor for methodology
