**Date**: December 2025  
**Status**: Complete  
**Critical Gaps**: None  
**Minor Gaps**: 3 (all non-blocking)

---

## Critical Gaps (Blocking Issues)

**None identified.** All 8 stages of the essay have adequate source coverage with Tier 1-2 sources.

---

## Minor Gaps (Non-Blocking)

### Gap 1: Historical Evolution of Money Creation Systems
**Description**: Limited sources on the historical development and evolution of money creation systems over time.

**Impact**: **LOW** - Not needed for process-focused essay. Essay focuses on modern mechanics, not historical evolution.

**Status**: **ACCEPTABLE** - Historical context may be referenced briefly but is not central to the essay's purpose.

**Action**: None required. Essay scope explicitly focuses on modern money creation.

---

### Gap 2: Comprehensive International Comparisons
**Description**: Sources mention differences between US, EU, UK systems but don't provide comprehensive side-by-side comparison.

**Impact**: **LOW** - Not needed for essay scope. Essay uses US, EU, UK as examples but doesn't require comprehensive comparison.

**Status**: **ACCEPTABLE** - Essay uses examples from different systems to illustrate principles, not to compare systems.

**Action**: None required. Essay scope explicitly excludes comprehensive international comparisons.

---

### Gap 3: Detailed Money Velocity Calculations
**Description**: Sources mention money velocity but don't provide detailed mathematical explanations or calculations.

**Impact**: **LOW** - Essay explicitly states "explain without heavy math." Velocity is mentioned conceptually, not calculated.

**Status**: **ACCEPTABLE** - Essay requirements specify avoiding heavy math. Conceptual explanation is sufficient.

**Action**: None required. Essay will explain velocity conceptually, not mathematically.

## Explicitly Excluded (By Design)

These are not gaps—they are intentionally excluded from research scope:

1. **Political Arguments**: No partisan framing, no moral judgments about the monetary system
2. **Investment Advice**: Not a guide to investing or financial planning
3. **Cryptocurrency Deep Dive**: May reference but not primary focus
4. **Historical Deep Dive**: Evolution may be referenced but focus is on modern mechanics
5. **Comprehensive International Comparisons**: May use examples but not side-by-side comparison

## Areas with Limited but Adequate Coverage

### Government Spending Mechanics
**Status**: **ADEQUATE** - Sources cover Treasury operations, bond issuance, government borrowing. Less detailed than bank lending, but sufficient for Stage 5.

**Coverage**: Bank of England explainer on government borrowing, Federal Reserve publications on Treasury operations.

**Action**: None required. Coverage is adequate for essay scope.

---

### Money Destruction Details
**Status**: **ADEQUATE** - Sources confirm money destruction through loan repayment and defaults. Less detailed than creation, but sufficient for Stage 7.

**Coverage**: Bank of England explainer, multiple sources confirm destruction mechanics.

**Action**: None required. Coverage is adequate for essay scope.

---

## Research Limitations

### Source Limitations
- **No Primary Research**: All sources are secondary (publications, explainers, textbooks). This is appropriate for an explanatory essay.
- **No Original Data Analysis**: Essay doesn't require original data analysis—uses existing authoritative sources.
- **No Expert Interviews**: Essay doesn't require expert interviews—central bank publications are authoritative.

### Methodology Limitations
- **Focus on Modern Systems**: Research focused on US, EU, UK systems. Other systems (Japan, China, etc.) not deeply researched. This is acceptable per essay scope.
- **Process Focus**: Research focused on mechanics, not policy debates or economic theories. This aligns with essay requirements.

## Claims That Cannot Be Made

Based on research gaps and limitations, the essay **cannot** make these claims:

1. ❌ **"Money creation has always worked this way"** - Historical evolution not deeply researched
2. ❌ **"All countries create money identically"** - Comprehensive international comparison not conducted
3. ❌ **"Money velocity is X"** - Detailed velocity calculations not available
4. ❌ **"Government spending always has Y effect"** - Effects vary by context, not universally applicable
5. ❌ **"This system is good/bad"** - Political/moral judgments explicitly excluded

---

## Claims That Can Be Made (With High Confidence)

Based on research, the essay **can** make these claims:

1. ✅ **"Commercial banks create money through lending"** - Strong consensus, multiple Tier 1 sources
2. ✅ **"Loans create deposits, not the reverse"** - Confirmed by Bank of England, ECB, academic research
3. ✅ **"Central banks influence but don't directly create most money"** - Consistent across all central bank publications
4. ✅ **"Money is destroyed through loan repayment"** - Confirmed by multiple sources
5. ✅ **"Capital requirements constrain money creation"** - Federal Reserve research confirms
6. ✅ **"QE works through asset purchases and reserve credits"** - Mechanics confirmed by Fed and Bank of England
7. ✅ **"Inflation is a system outcome, not just printing money"** - General agreement on supply/demand factors

---

## Recommendations

1. **Proceed with Essay**: No critical gaps identified. Research is complete and adequate.
2. **Use GAPS.md During Writing**: Writers should reference this document to avoid making unsupported claims.
3. **Emphasize Supported Claims**: Focus on high-confidence claims with strong source backing.
4. **Acknowledge Limitations**: If historical context is mentioned, acknowledge it's brief, not comprehensive.

## Status

**Research Gaps Assessment**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Conclusion**: Research package is **adequate** for essay production. No blocking gaps identified. All 8 stages have sufficient source coverage. Minor gaps are acceptable and align with essay scope limitations.
