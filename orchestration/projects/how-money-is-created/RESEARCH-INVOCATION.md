# Phase 2: Research Invocation

**Date**: December 2025  
**Status**: ⏳ In Progress  
**Gate**: G2 (Research Complete) - Pending

## Research Orchestrator Invocation

```
Using @orchestration/agents/orchestrators/research-orchestrator.md:

Topic: How Money Is Created
Depth: Deep
Domain: Auto (likely Economics/Policy, may include History lens for evolution)

Research Blueprint: @orchestration/skills/visual-essay-invocation/SKILL.md

Research must satisfy these SKILL.md requirements:
- Layer 4 Figure Profiles: Find 5-15 figures with imagery + quotes (if they illustrate the process)
- Layer 4 Narrative Beats: Map verified timeline of events (policy decisions, QE programs, regulatory changes)
- Layer 4 Visual Assets: Identify available technical illustrations, diagrams, flow charts
- Layer 5 Era Treatments: Document historical periods for visual processing (if applicable)
- Quotes: Minimum 10 verified quotes with sources (explaining money creation mechanics)

Produce research package that MAPS to spec template.

Essay Slug: how-money-is-created
Output Location: orchestration/projects/how-money-is-created/research/

## Research Priorities (from Intake)

### HIGH PRIORITY

**Institutions & Mechanisms**:
- Central bank operations (Fed, ECB, Bank of England)
- Commercial banking mechanics (loan creation, deposit creation, balance sheet expansion)
- Treasury operations (government spending, bond issuance, deficit mechanics)
- Quantitative easing programs (historical examples, mechanics)
- Regulatory frameworks (capital requirements, reserve requirements, Basel accords)

**Key Concepts**:
- Money multiplier myth vs. reality
- Endogenous money theory
- Credit creation mechanics
- Balance sheet operations (central bank, commercial banks, government)
- Money velocity (explain without heavy math)
- Inflation mechanisms (supply vs. demand, time lags)

**Academic & Institutional Sources**:
- Federal Reserve publications (Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation, etc.)
- European Central Bank publications
- Bank of England publications (especially "Money Creation in the Modern Economy")
- Bank for International Settlements (BIS) papers
- Economics textbooks (Mankiw, Krugman, etc.)
- Academic papers on endogenous money, credit creation

**Visual Materials**:
- Balance sheet diagrams (before/after loan creation)
- Flow charts (money creation process)
- Technical illustrations (central bank operations, QE mechanics)
- Data visualizations (only if they clarify the process)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Figures** (only if they illustrate the process):
- Central bank governors/policymakers (only if their decisions illustrate the process)
- Key economists whose work explains the mechanics (not for biography, but for theoretical clarity)

**Timeline/Events**:
- Major policy decisions that illustrate money creation
- QE program launches (historical examples)
- Regulatory changes affecting money creation

**Quotes**:
- Minimum 10 verified quotes explaining money creation mechanics
- Quotes from central bank publications
- Quotes from economists explaining the process

```
orchestration/projects/how-money-is-created/research/
├── README.md              # Directory overview
├── RESEARCH-BRIEF.md      # Questions, scope, methodology (Deep mode)
├── CITATIONS.md           # All sources with verification (REQUIRED)
├── SYNTHESIS.md           # Key findings, patterns
├── GAPS.md                # Unanswered questions
└── CONFIDENCE-MATRIX.md   # Claim → Evidence → Confidence
```

## Gate 2 Requirements

For G2 (Research Complete) to pass:

- [ ] research/ directory exists
- [ ] CITATIONS.md complete (15-25 sources minimum for Deep mode)
- [ ] SYNTHESIS.md complete
- [ ] RESEARCH-BRIEF.md complete
- [ ] GAPS.md complete
- [ ] CONFIDENCE-MATRIX.md complete
- [ ] All links validated
- [ ] Sources are Tier 1-2 (central bank publications, academic research, economics textbooks)
- [ ] Quotes verified with sources
- [ ] Visual materials identified (diagrams, flow charts, technical illustrations)

## Notes

- This is a **process-driven** essay, so figures are secondary to mechanism explanations
- Focus on **institutional sources** (Fed, ECB, Bank of England, BIS) as primary
- Visual treatment is **technical illustrations**, not photography
- Tone must support **neutral, mechanical, educational** approach
- This is **core Esy content** — source quality is critical
