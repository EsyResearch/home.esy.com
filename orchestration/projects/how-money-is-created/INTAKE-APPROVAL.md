## SKILL.md Research Requirements Analysis

Based on `@orchestration/skills/visual-essay-invocation/SKILL.md`, the research must gather:

### Layer 4 Requirements

| SKILL.md Requirement | Research Must Gather | Status |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Figure Profiles** (5-15 figures) | Key economists, central bank governors, policymakers who illustrate the process | ⏳ Pending |
| **Key Quotes** | Verified quotes explaining money creation mechanics | ⏳ Pending |
| **Narrative Beats** | Timeline of money creation events, policy decisions, system changes | ⏳ Pending |
| **Visual Assets** | Balance sheet diagrams, flow charts, technical illustrations, minimal photography | ⏳ Pending |

### Layer 5 Requirements

| SKILL.md Requirement | Research Must Gather | Status |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Era Treatments** | Historical periods requiring distinct visual processing (if applicable) | ⏳ Pending |
| **Visual Treatment** | Confirm technical illustration approach, diagram sources | ⏳ Pending |

### Process-Specific Requirements

This essay is **process-driven** (not narrative-driven), so research priorities differ:

| Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Institutional mechanisms** | HIGH | Central bank operations, commercial banking mechanics |
| **Key concepts** | HIGH | Credit creation, endogenous money, balance sheet operations |
| **Academic sources** | HIGH | Fed, ECB, Bank of England publications, BIS papers |
| **Figures** | MEDIUM | Only if they illustrate the process (not biographical focus) |
| **Timeline/events** | MEDIUM | Policy decisions, QE programs, regulatory changes |
| **Visual materials** | HIGH | Balance sheet diagrams, flow charts, technical illustrations |

## Research Requirements Brief

### Project Identification
- **Working Title**: How Money Is Created
- **Topic**: Modern money creation mechanics (credit-based system)
- **Date Initiated**: December 2025
- **Depth Mode**: **Deep** (full visual essay, complex topic, requires authoritative sources)

### Research Targets (from Intake Document)

#### Institutions & Mechanisms (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Central bank operations (Fed, ECB, Bank of England as examples)
- [ ] Commercial banking mechanics (loan creation, deposit creation, balance sheet expansion)
- [ ] Treasury operations (government spending, bond issuance, deficit mechanics)
- [ ] Quantitative easing programs (historical examples, mechanics)
- [ ] Regulatory frameworks (capital requirements, reserve requirements, Basel accords)

#### Key Concepts (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Money multiplier myth vs. reality
- [ ] Endogenous money theory
- [ ] Credit creation mechanics
- [ ] Balance sheet operations (central bank, commercial banks, government)
- [ ] Money velocity (explain without heavy math)
- [ ] Inflation mechanisms (supply vs. demand, time lags)

#### Figures (MEDIUM PRIORITY - Process Illustrators Only)
- [ ] Central bank governors/policymakers (only if their decisions illustrate the process)
- [ ] Key economists whose work explains the mechanics (not for biography, but for theoretical clarity)
- **Target**: 5-15 figures, but only if they serve the process explanation

#### Timeline/Events (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Major policy decisions that illustrate money creation
- [ ] QE program launches (historical examples)
- [ ] Regulatory changes affecting money creation
- [ ] Turning points in understanding money creation

#### Visual Materials (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Balance sheet diagrams (before/after loan creation)
- [ ] Flow charts (money creation process)
- [ ] Technical illustrations (central bank operations, QE mechanics)
- [ ] Minimal photography (central bank buildings, trading floors—only if it serves context)
- [ ] Data visualizations (only if they clarify the process, not decoration)

#### Academic & Institutional Sources (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Federal Reserve publications (Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation, etc.)
- [ ] European Central Bank publications
- [ ] Bank of England publications (especially "Money Creation in the Modern Economy")
- [ ] Bank for International Settlements (BIS) papers
- [ ] Economics textbooks (Mankiw, Krugman, etc.)
- [ ] Academic papers on endogenous money, credit creation

#### Quotes (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Minimum 10 verified quotes explaining money creation mechanics
- [ ] Quotes from central bank publications
- [ ] Quotes from economists explaining the process
- [ ] Attribution confirmed for each

### Research Depth
- [x] **Deep** (15-25 sources for full visual essay)
- [ ] Standard (10-15 sources)
- [ ] Quick (5-10 sources for shorter piece)

**Rationale**: This is a complex, process-driven essay requiring authoritative institutional sources. Deep mode ensures comprehensive coverage of central bank publications, academic research, and technical explanations.

## Next Steps

**Phase 2: Research** — Invoke Research Orchestrator with:
- Topic: How Money Is Created
- Depth: Deep
- Domain: Auto-detect (likely Economics/Policy, may require History lens for evolution)
- Research Blueprint: SKILL.md requirements (as documented above)

## Notes

- This is a **process-driven** essay, not narrative-driven, so figure profiles are secondary to mechanism explanations
- Visual treatment is **text-forward with technical illustrations** (not photorealistic)
- Tone must be **neutral, mechanical, educational** — no ideology, no panic, no political arguments
- Sources must be **Tier 1-2** (central bank publications, academic research, economics textbooks)
- This is **core Esy content** — high intellectual credibility, reference-quality, evergreen
