## Architecture Overview

This is a **process-driven** visual essay, not a narrative-driven one. The structure follows 8 distinct stages that explain money creation as a mechanical system. Each stage functions as a mechanism clicking into place.

**Total Sections**: 10 (Opening + 8 Stages + Closing)  
**Layout Patterns**: 5 different patterns  
**Scroll-Lock Sequences**: 8 sequences (Hero + 7 stage sequences)
