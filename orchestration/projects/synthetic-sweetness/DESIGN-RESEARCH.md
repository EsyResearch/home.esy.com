## Design Research Overview

Synthetic Sweetness chronicles humanity's 8,000-year quest to harness sweetness—from sugar cane fields to laboratory accidents. The visual identity must convey transformation across eras: colonial trade, scientific discovery, regulatory battles, and modern commercial proliferation. This is a story of chemistry, commerce, and contested evidence—requiring a design system that feels simultaneously scientific, commercial, and slightly unsettling.

## Visual Identity Analysis

### Subject Matter Characteristics

**Subject Is**:
- Industrial/scientific (laboratory discoveries, chemical compounds)
- Commercial/consumerist (product packaging, branding, supermarket shelves)
- Regulatory/bureaucratic (FDA documents, congressional battles, approval letters)
- Morally complex (slavery, contested health claims, corporate influence)
- Time-spanning (8000 BCE to present—multiple eras to traverse)

**Subject Is NOT**:
- Purely natural/organic (even "natural" sweeteners are industrially processed)
- Simple or settled (evidence remains genuinely contested)
- Celebratory or nostalgic (sugar's history includes violence)
- Focused on a single person or moment (it's systemic, evolutionary)

### Visual Treatment Decision

**Primary Medium**: Archival Photography with Data Visualization

**Rationale**:
1. Historical credibility requires documentary photography across eras
2. Regulatory story demands authentic document imagery
3. Consumption data needs clear, compelling visualization
4. Product evolution benefits from real packaging photography
5. Scientific claims require visual evidence, not illustration

## Animation Philosophy

### Subject Nature → Animation Approach

**Subject Is**:
- Scientific (laboratory precision, molecular chemistry)
- Commercial (product packaging, market competition)
- Regulatory (pendulum swings, bureaucratic process)
- Data-driven (consumption peaks, trend lines)
- Temporal (spanning 8000 years, multiple distinct eras)

**Animation Should**:
- Feel like **crystallization**—slow, precise, transformative
- Support **revelation**—documents declassified, data exposed
- Reveal **patterns**—the regulatory pendulum, the accidental discovery
- Be **measured** not frenetic—documentary pacing, not commercial advertising
- Respect **gravity**—slavery, contested health claims, corporate influence

### Animation Principles

**Scroll-Lock Sequences**:
- Purpose: Major revelations (discoveries, approvals, consumption peaks)
- Feel: Cinematic but restrained; Ken Burns effect on archival photos
- Timing: 1500-3000px per sequence; substantial but not exhausting
- Easing: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0)—smooth, natural, deliberate

**Parallax**:
- Intensity: Subtle to moderate (0.3x - 1.3x range)
- Rationale: Creates depth without overwhelming archival photography
- Layer separation: Background atmosphere, mid-ground context, foreground subject

**Animation Timing**:
- Photo transitions: 500ms crossfade (documentary pacing)
- Text reveals: 300ms fade-up, 80ms stagger (readable, not rushed)
- Data animations: 800ms draw (time to comprehend)
- Era transitions: 600ms gradient shift (perceptible but smooth)
- Lock release: 400ms ease-out (clean exit from scroll-lock)

## Visual Style Guide

### Photography Approach

**Era-Based Processing** (Critical for authenticity):

| Era | Treatment | Color | Grain | Contrast |
|-----|-----------|-------|-------|----------|
| Colonial (1500-1900) | Sepia overlay 30% | Warm desaturated | Heavy, weathered | High |
| Scientific (1879-1960) | True B&W | Neutral grays | Period-appropriate | Sharp |
| Regulatory (1960-1990) | Kodachrome warmth | Saturated warm | Light film grain | Moderate |
| Modern (1990-2025) | Clean commercial | Accurate color | None | Standard |

**Transition Treatment**: As users scroll through time, CSS filters shift gradually. The sepia of colonial sugar fades to black-and-white science, warms to Kodachrome regulation, clarifies to modern commercial. Scroll drives the color grading.

### Visual Progression

1. **Opening**: Dark, mysterious, crystalline ambiguity (spoon with powder)
2. **Colonial**: Warm sepia, plantation landscapes, human faces
3. **Discovery**: Black-and-white laboratory precision, scientist portraits
4. **Regulation**: Document-heavy, government aesthetic, warm 1970s-80s color
5. **Modern**: Clean commercial photography, data visualization, product packaging
6. **Resolution**: Data-driven clarity, charts showing decline, open question framing

## Progress Bar Concept

**Concept**: "The Sweetness Gradient"

**Visual Design**:
- Vertical bar on left edge (4px, expanding to 8px on hover)
- Gradient fill transitioning through eras: brown → white → pink → blue → yellow → green
- Chapter notches with title tooltips on hover
- Glowing node indicating current position
- Colors match the essay's sweetener-era associations

**Subject Connection**:
- The gradient IS the story: sugar (brown) → crystallization (white) → saccharin (pink) → aspartame (blue) → sucralose (yellow) → stevia (green)
- Visual progression matches narrative chronology
- Each sweetener era gets its signature color in the progress visualization

**Justification**:
This progress bar concept could only exist for THIS essay. The color sequence directly reflects the chronological development of sweeteners and their branding. A user glancing at the progress bar immediately sees where they are in the timeline.

## Layout Pattern Strategy

### Recommended Patterns (minimum 3, no consecutive same)

1. **Full-Bleed Photography** (`photo-full`)
   - For: Archival imagery, plantation scenes, laboratory moments
   - Rationale: Documentary credibility demands photography showcase

2. **Document Reveal** (`document-scroll`)
   - For: FDA notices, patent documents, Federal Register citations
   - Rationale: Regulatory story requires primary source evidence

3. **Data Visualization** (`chart-animate`)
   - For: Consumption trends, sweetener approval timeline, ADI comparisons
   - Rationale: Statistical claims need visual proof

4. **Figure Profile** (`portrait-quote`)
   - For: Key figures (Fahlberg, Remsen, Roosevelt, Hayes, Rumsfeld)
   - Rationale: Human anchors in institutional story

5. **Product Comparison** (`side-by-side`)
   - For: Before/after, then/now, packaging evolution
   - Rationale: Commercial dimension requires product visibility

6. **Timeline Cascade** (`timeline-stack`)
   - For: Regulatory milestones, discovery chronology
   - Rationale: Multi-event sequences need clear temporal structure

## Uniqueness Verification

### Comparison to Previous Essays

**NOT Like**:
- **the-manhattan-project**: No chain reaction metaphor; no countdown; different era palette (Manhattan is single-era, Sweetness spans millennia)
- **sweetness-engineered**: Completely different visual identity (user requirement: fresh design, no reference)
- **the-origin-of-toy**: No childhood whimsy; industrial/commercial tone instead
- **orwells-1984**: No dystopian surveillance aesthetic; scientific/regulatory tone

**IS Like**:
- Nothing in current catalog—this is a unique subject requiring unique treatment

**Unique Elements**:
- **Sweetness Gradient progress bar**: Color progression matching sweetener chronology
- **Era-based photo processing**: Sepia → B&W → Kodachrome → Modern (scroll-driven)
- **Packet color coding**: Pink/blue/yellow/green as semantic colors tied to sweeteners
- **Regulatory pendulum visualization**: Unique interaction for approval/ban oscillation
- **Crystallization motif**: Opening animation showing molecular formation

**Conclusion**: Visual identity is **unique** and could only exist for this specific subject. The color associations with specific sweetener brands, the era-based photo processing, and the gradient progress bar are all derived directly from this topic's materials and history.
