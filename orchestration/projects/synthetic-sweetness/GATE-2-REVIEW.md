## Key Research Findings

### 1. Narrative Thread: Accidental Discovery Pattern
All major artificial sweeteners (saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame, acesulfame-K, sucralose) were discovered accidentally by chemists tasting compounds they shouldn't have.

### 2. Narrative Thread: Regulatory Pendulum
Consistent pattern of adoption → concern → investigation → (usually) reaffirmation. Pattern continues to present day (2023 IARC/JECFA).

### 3. Data Insight: Consumption Peak
US per capita sweetener consumption peaked in 1999 at 153.6 lbs, down 19.6% to 123.5 lbs by 2023. HFCS down 40% from peak.

### 4. Evidence Status: Genuinely Contested
WHO 2023 recommends against NNS for weight control; UK SACN 2025 challenges this. RCTs show benefits; observational studies show concerns. Present both sides.

### 5. Sensitive Content: Slavery
Sugar's colonial history requires direct acknowledgment of enslaved labor. Using "enslaved people" (not "slaves") and documenting 12.5 million transported.

## Gaps and Risks

### Documented Gaps
- Limited imagery for Fahlberg, Sveda, Schlatter, Phadnis
- Pre-1970 consumption data less reliable
- Health effects genuinely uncertain for long-term outcomes

### Mitigation
- Use available portraits (Remsen, Wiley, Roosevelt) prominently
- Label historical estimates with sources
- Present scientific uncertainty as feature, not bug
