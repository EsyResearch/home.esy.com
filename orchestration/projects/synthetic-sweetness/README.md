## Critical Notes

⚠️ **Fresh Start Philosophy**: This essay has a unique visual identity. Do NOT reference existing essays for patterns or inspiration.

⚠️ **Evidence First**: No health claims without proper source tier documentation.

⚠️ **Distinction Required**: Always distinguish "availability" from "intake" when discussing consumption data.
