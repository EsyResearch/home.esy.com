## Intake Details

### Topic

**The Global History of Sugar Consumption and the Rise of Artificial Sweeteners in America**

A comprehensive, photo-led scrollytelling visual essay tracing sugar's transformation from luxury commodity to industrial staple, with a central narrative emphasis on when, why, and how non-nutritive (high-intensity) sweeteners entered American foods and expanded over time. The essay examines the interplay of technology, regulation, economics, marketing, diet culture, and consumer demand.

**Working Title**: "Sweetness Engineered: A Visual Timeline of Sugar and Artificial Sweeteners"

**Alternative Titles** (4-10 words, not sensational, conveying industry/policy/consumer themes):
1. "The Industrial History of American Sweetness"
2. "Sugar's Synthetic Substitutes: A Policy Timeline"
3. "Manufacturing Sweet: Science, Industry, and Taste"
4. "How America Engineered Its Sweet Tooth"
5. "From Cane Fields to Chemistry Labs: Sweetness Transformed"

---

### Target Audience

**Primary**: Curious intelligent readers, educators, students
- No prior knowledge of food science, chemistry, or regulatory policy assumed
- Readers who appreciate rigorous, well-sourced information
- Those seeking understanding over sensationalism

**What they know coming in**:
- General awareness that "artificial sweeteners" exist
- Vague sense that sugar consumption has increased over time
- May have heard conflicting health claims about sweeteners

**What they should know leaving**:
- Clear taxonomy of caloric vs. non-nutritive sweeteners
- Timeline of when each major sweetener entered US foods and why
- How regulation, industry, and consumer demand shaped adoption
- What evidence does and doesn't say about health impacts
- How to evaluate sweetener-related health claims critically

---

### Visual Treatment

**Primary Approach**: Photorealistic, archival-led with data visualization integration

**Visual Elements**:
- Archival photography (sugar plantations, refineries, early labs, FDA facilities)
- Historical advertisements and product packaging (before/after comparisons)
- Regulatory document imagery (FDA approvals, Federal Register notices)
- Laboratory and manufacturing photography
- Product evolution timelines (packaging design changes)
- Data visualizations (consumption trends, market shifts, regulatory overlays)

**Visual Sources to Prioritize**:
- Library of Congress (historical sugar industry, trade, advertising)
- National Archives (FDA records, regulatory history)
- Smithsonian National Museum of American History (food/beverage artifacts)
- FDA History Office image galleries
- Brand archives (Coca-Cola, PepsiCo historical materials)
- University special collections (food science, advertising history)

**Visual Treatment Notes**:
- Public domain preferred; Creative Commons acceptable
- Rights-managed materials flagged for licensing review
- Alt text required for all hero images
- Charts must be color-independent readable

---

### Scope Priorities

1. **US Non-Nutritive Sweetener Adoption** — When, why, and how each major sweetener entered American foods (minimum 6 sweeteners: saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame, acesulfame-K, sucralose, neotame, advantame, steviol glycosides, monk fruit)

2. **Regulatory History** — FDA approvals, GRAS notices, bans, labeling changes, ADI limits with primary source documentation

3. **Global Sugar Context** — Trade history, industrialization, processed food rise (framing for US story)

4. **Evidence-Based Health Discussion** — Clear distinction between RCTs, cohort studies, mechanistic research; correlation vs. causation explicit

5. **Market and Cultural Forces** — Diet culture, low-fat era, reformulation incentives, "zero sugar" branding evolution

---

### Narrative Tone Directive

**Primary Mode**: EDUCATOR (museum exhibit meets investigative explainer)

**Voice Characteristics**:
- Measured, precise, historically grounded
- Not alarmist or sensational
- Claims proportionate to evidence
- Comfortable acknowledging uncertainty
- Separates correlation from causation explicitly

**Avoid**:
- Sensationalism or fear-mongering
- Overclaiming health effects in either direction
- Conflating "availability" with "consumption" without explanation
- Presenting observational findings as causal
- Industry apologetics or anti-industry polemic
- Vague sourcing ("studies show...")

**Model After**:
- High-quality museum exhibits (Smithsonian food history)
- Investigative explainer journalism (ProPublica, NYT Upshot)
- Academic popular science (works that explain without dumbing down)

---

### Special Requirements

#### Evidence Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Source Hierarchy**:
1. Primary regulatory documents (FDA actions, Federal Register, GRAS notices)
2. Authoritative public health bodies (WHO/FAO, CDC, USDA, EFSA, JECFA)
3. Peer-reviewed syntheses (systematic reviews, meta-analyses)
4. High-quality cohort studies and RCTs
5. Reputable institutional histories (for older sugar history)

**Citation Requirements**:
- Every scene: 2-4 citations directly supporting claims
- At least one primary/authoritative source for dates, approvals, bans, health claims
- Stable links preferred (DOI, PubMed, agency PDFs)
- No vague "(source)" citations—identify what each source is

**Data Integrity Rules**:
- Specify measurement type: availability/disappearance, self-reported intake, sales/market share
- Explain implications in captions
- Never conflate metrics without explicit acknowledgment

#### Definitions Required (early in essay)

Must define clearly:
- Sugar / added sugars / free sugars (WHO framing)
- Caloric sweeteners (sucrose, HFCS, glucose syrup)
- Non-nutritive / low-calorie / high-intensity sweeteners
- Artificial vs. naturally derived high-intensity sweeteners (taxonomy)
- Per-capita availability vs. actual intake (and why they differ)

#### Health Content Requirements

- Include medical disclaimer: informational only, not medical advice
- State what is known, what is uncertain, why uncertain, what studies needed
- If evidence mixed, present balance explicitly
- If claim cannot be verified from credible sources, either omit or label as "commonly claimed but weakly sourced"

#### Sweetener Coverage (MINIMUM)

Must explicitly cover at least 6 of:
- Saccharin
- Cyclamate
- Aspartame
- Acesulfame-K
- Sucralose
- Neotame
- Advantame
- Steviol glycosides
- Monk fruit

For each: discovery, commercialization, FDA approval/GRAS status, adoption trajectory
