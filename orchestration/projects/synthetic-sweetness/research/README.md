## Research Priorities

1. **Regulatory milestones** — FDA approvals, bans, labeling changes with Federal Register citations
2. **Key figures** — Discoverers, regulators, industry executives with verified quotes
3. **Timeline** — Comprehensive chronology from saccharin (1879) to present
4. **Data sources** — USDA ERS, NHANES, beverage industry data
5. **Visual archives** — Library of Congress, National Archives, Smithsonian, FDA History

## Evidence Handling Notes

### Health Claims
- Document study type (RCT, cohort, mechanistic)
- Note sample size and population
- Disclose funding sources
- Acknowledge limitations

### Consumption Data
- **Availability**: Food supply disappearance data (what enters market)
- **Intake**: Self-reported dietary surveys (what people say they consume)
- **Sales**: Market transaction data
- Always specify which metric is being used

### Controversial Topics
Flag in GAPS.md if evidence insufficient:
- Long-term health outcomes
- Appetite/compensation effects
- Microbiome impacts
- Weight management efficacy
