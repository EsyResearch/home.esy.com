## Cross-Era Themes

### Theme 1: Accidental Discovery
All major artificial sweeteners discovered accidentally by tasting. Use consistent visual motif (laboratory scene, scientist, moment of recognition).

### Theme 2: Regulatory Pendulum
Pattern of approval → concern → investigation → (usually) reaffirmation. Visualize as oscillating timeline.

### Theme 3: War and Necessity
Sugar shortages (WWI, WWII) drove sweetener adoption. Show parallel timelines.

### Theme 4: Marketing Evolution
From medicine → diet aid → lifestyle choice → health tool. Track packaging and messaging evolution.

### Theme 5: Scientific Uncertainty
How do we know what we know? Show study types, limitations, evolving understanding. Avoid false certainty.
