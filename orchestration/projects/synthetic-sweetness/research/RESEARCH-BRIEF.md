## Special Research Notes

### Handle With Care

1. **Health outcome claims** — Do not overstate. If evidence is mixed, say so explicitly in GAPS.md

2. **"Consumption" vs "availability"** — Always specify which metric. USDA data is availability (food supply disappearance), not actual intake.

3. **Industry influence** — Document funding sources for studies. Flag industry-funded research.

4. **Cyclamate ban** — Controversial; ensure primary sources on the actual evidence and decision process.

5. **Aspartame approval** — Well-documented controversy; get primary FDA documents, not just news coverage.

6. **Stevia/monk fruit** — "Natural" framing is marketing; these are highly processed extracts. Note the distinction.

7. **ADI limits** — Explain what ADI means, how it's calculated (NOAEL/100), and typical intake vs ADI.

8. **WHO 2023 NNS guideline** — Recent and important; get the actual WHO technical report, not news summaries.
