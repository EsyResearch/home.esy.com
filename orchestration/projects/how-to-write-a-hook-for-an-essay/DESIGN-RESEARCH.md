# Design Research Report: How to Write a Hook for an Essay - The Cognitive Architecture of Openings

**Date**: December 2025
**Status**: Complete
**Gate**: G4 - Design Research

---

## Design Research Overview

This visual essay treats essay hooks as **cognitive mechanisms** - not tips, not formulas, but architectural structures that facilitate the reader's transition from their world into the essay's world. The central metaphor is **THE DOORWAY/THRESHOLD** - hooks function as cognitive portals that transform readers through the act of crossing.

**Key Challenge**: Create a visual identity that is:
- Typography-forward (type IS the illustration)
- Architecturally grounded (doorways, portals, thresholds)
- Cognitively precise (information gaps, working memory, event boundaries)
- Rhetorically rooted (classical rhetoric tradition: Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian)
- Transformational (before/liminal/after states)

**Subject Research Sources**:
- George Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory of Curiosity (1994)
- Gabriel Radvansky's Doorway Effect research on event boundaries
- Arnold van Gennep's rites of passage (separation, liminality, reincorporation)
- Victor Turner's elaboration of liminality and communitas
- Classical rhetoric: Aristotle, Cicero's six-part structure, Quintilian's *Institutio Oratoria*
- Propylaea of Athens and classical threshold architecture

## Visual Identity Analysis

### Subject Matter Characteristics

**The Subject IS**:
- Cognitive (information gaps, working memory, event boundaries)
- Architectural (doorways, thresholds, portals as spatial metaphors)
- Transformational (reader undergoes change through crossing)
- Pedagogical (teaching how to write, rooted in classical rhetoric)
- Liminal (operating in the space between states)
- Abstract (concepts visualized through type, not photography)

**The Subject Is NOT**:
- Tip-based (not "5 tips for better hooks")
- Decorative (typography serves meaning, not ornament)
- Historical-narrative (not a timeline of rhetoric)
- Photographic (no images - type IS the visual)
- Casual (treats writing with architectural seriousness)

### Visual Treatment Decision

**Primary Medium**: **Typographic Architecture**

**Rationale**:
1. Typography becomes doorways, frames, and thresholds - type forms the architecture
2. No photography or illustration - letterforms create all visual interest
3. The essay teaches writing; the medium (typography) reinforces the message
4. Classical rhetoric was transmitted through manuscripts where typography was sacred
5. Information gaps can be visualized through typographic reveals and negative space
6. The doorway effect (cognitive event boundaries) can be embodied through typographic transitions

**NOT Using**:
- Photography (type is the only illustration)
- Traditional illustration
- Stock imagery
- Decorative patterns unconnected to subject

## Visual Archaeology Findings

### Primary Materials & Associations

**Architectural Thresholds**:
- **Materials**: Stone (marble, limestone, granite), carved inscriptions, columns, architraves
- **Textures**: Carved letters in stone, the weight of classical portals
- **Examples**: Propylaea of Athens - monumental gateway with columns, procession through sacred space
- **Colors**: Warm stone tones (cream, ivory, buff), shadows creating depth

**Classical Rhetoric Manuscripts**:
- **Materials**: Parchment, vellum, gold leaf illumination
- **Textures**: Aged paper, ink, decorated initials
- **Typography**: Roman square capitals (Trajan), medieval illuminated letters
- **Colors**: Cream parchment (#F1E9D2), iron gall ink (deep brown-black), gold accents

**Educational/Pedagogical Tradition**:
- **Materials**: Chalkboards (black/green), chalk, printed textbooks
- **Textures**: Matte surfaces, clear typography hierarchy
- **Typography**: Clear serifs for readability, structured hierarchies
- **Colors**: Chalkboard green (#355E3B), chalk white, pedagogical clarity

**Cognitive Science Visualization**:
- **Materials**: Clean diagrams, conceptual abstractions, mental model representations
- **Textures**: Minimal, focused, clarity-oriented
- **Typography**: Sans-serif for diagrams, monospace for technical precision
- **Colors**: Neutral backgrounds, high-contrast elements

### Historical Color Associations

- **Stone/Threshold**: Warm creams, buff limestone (#E8DEC9), marble whites
- **Manuscript/Rhetoric**: Parchment (#F1E9D2), iron gall brown-black (#1A1510), gold leaf (#D4AF37)
- **Pedagogy/Education**: Chalkboard green-black, chalk white, clear contrast
- **Liminality/Transformation**: The space between - gradients from exterior to interior

### Recurring Visual Motifs

1. **The Doorway/Portal**: Frame shapes created by typography - letterforms forming thresholds
2. **The Threshold Line**: Horizontal demarcation between states (before/liminal/after)
3. **The Illuminated Initial**: Decorated first letters in the tradition of manuscripts
4. **The Procession Path**: Leading the eye through structured space (like Greek propylaea)
5. **The Event Boundary**: Visual markers that signal cognitive transition
6. **The Opening Door**: Progressive reveal - from closed to open

## Typography Selection

### Typography Philosophy

This essay is **typographic-forward** - type itself serves as illustration. Typography must:
1. Form architectural shapes (doorways, frames, thresholds)
2. Honor classical rhetoric manuscript traditions
3. Enable progressive revelation (information gap visualization)
4. Achieve outstanding beauty that serves meaning

### Typography Stack

**Display/Headlines**: **Trajan Pro** - because it derives directly from Roman monumental inscriptions (Trajan's Column), connecting to classical rhetoric's stone-carved origins. Trajan's capitals embody the weight and authority of the rhetorical tradition from Aristotle through Quintilian. Use for section titles, major threshold markers, and "doorway" headings.
- Alternative: **Libre Baskerville** - transitional serif connecting 18th-century rhetoric revival
- Weight: 700 (Bold) for architectural weight

**Serif Body**: **Adobe Caslon Pro** - because William Caslon's typeface has been used for scholarly and academic texts since the 18th century, particularly appropriate for pedagogical content about writing. Caslon's intellectual seriousness matches the subject's treatment of hooks as cognitive mechanisms, not casual tips.
- Weight: 400 (Regular) for body, 600 for emphasis
- Connects to: English typographic tradition, scholarly publishing

**Quote/Exordium Font**: **EB Garamond** - because Claude Garamond's 16th-century designs were created during the Renaissance revival of classical rhetoric, making this the most rhetorically appropriate font for displaying classical quotes from Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian.
- Weight: 400 Italic for quotes
- Connects to: Renaissance rhetoric, classical manuscript tradition

**Technical/Cognitive**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Fira Code** - because cognitive science visualizations and technical explanations require the precision of monospace type. Information gap diagrams, working memory models, and technical concepts benefit from code-like clarity.
- Weight: 400
- Connects to: Cognitive science visualization tradition

**Architectural Display**: **Bodoni Moda** - because Bodoni's extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes creates architectural tension that embodies threshold crossing. Use for typographic "doorway" constructions where letters form portal frames.
- Weight: 900 (Black) for architectural mass
- Connects to: Neoclassical typography, architectural proportion

### Typography as Architecture

The essay should feature moments where **typography forms doorways**:
- Giant letterforms create portal shapes (a massive "H" with text passing through)
- Brackets and frames made from punctuation
- Negative space as the threshold to cross
- Letters scaling from tiny (outside) to large (inside) as reader "enters"

### Typography Hierarchy

| Level | Typeface | Size (Desktop) | Size (Mobile) | Purpose |
|-------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| H1 - Portal Title | Trajan Pro | 72px | 48px | Major threshold markers |
| H2 - Chapter | Bodoni Moda | 48px | 32px | Section doorways |
| H3 - Section | Libre Baskerville | 32px | 24px | Interior headings |
| Body | Adobe Caslon | 20px | 18px | Primary text |
| Quotes | EB Garamond Italic | 24px | 20px | Classical sources |
| Technical | JetBrains Mono | 16px | 14px | Cognitive diagrams |
| Caption | Caslon | 14px | 12px | Supporting information |

## Animation Philosophy

### Subject Nature - Animation Approach

**Hooks/Thresholds Are**:
- Transformational (reader changes through crossing)
- Momentary (the crossing is brief but significant)
- Architectural (have spatial properties)
- Cognitive (involve mental state changes)

**Animation Should**:
- Feel like "crossing a threshold" - deliberate, weighted, meaningful
- Support the doorway effect - clear event boundaries in scroll
- Reveal information gaps - create and then resolve curiosity
- Honor liminality - the in-between state has distinct character

### Animation Principles

**Scroll-Lock Sequences** (The Threshold Crossing):
- **Purpose**: Embody the reader's passage through cognitive thresholds
- **Feel**: Deliberate, weighted, ceremonial (like processing through propylaea)
- **Timing**: 1200-1500ms for major thresholds (slow enough to feel the crossing)
- **Easing**: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` - ease-in-out with slight acceleration into the space

**Doorway Opening Animation**:
- When readers reach a new section, typography "opens" like a door
- Text parts like curtains/doors revealing content behind
- Subtle shadow/depth changes as if moving into an interior space
- Duration: 800ms for the opening, 400ms for content reveal

**Information Gap Reveals**:
- Questions posed with delayed answers (create the gap, then fill it)
- Text reveals progressively - not all at once
- Incomplete letterforms that complete as reader engages
- Duration: 600ms for gap creation, 400ms for resolution

**Threshold Crossing Transitions**:
- Before-state: Text in exterior colors (brighter, cooler)
- Liminal-state: Transition through neutral grays
- After-state: Text in interior colors (warmer, more saturated)
- Duration: 1000ms for state transitions

**Parallax Philosophy**:
- Minimal but meaningful
- Background elements (stone texture suggestions) at 0.3x
- Typography at 1x (the reader moves WITH the type)
- Accent elements (gold highlights) at 1.2x (feel closer)

### Animation Timing Table

| Element | Duration | Easing | Rationale |
|---------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Threshold crossing | 1200ms | ease-in-out | Deliberate, ceremonial passage |
| Door opening | 800ms | ease-out | Natural opening motion |
| Text reveal | 400ms | ease-out | Quick but not jarring |
| Information gap fill | 600ms | cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) | Build anticipation |
| State transition | 1000ms | ease-in-out | Smooth transformation |
| Quote entrance | 500ms | ease-out | Respectful appearance |

### Reduced Motion Considerations

- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Doorway effects become simple fades
- Scroll-lock sequences can be skipped immediately
- Static typographic compositions for accessibility

## Visual Motifs

### Primary Motifs (Derived from Subject Research)

1. **The Typographic Doorway**
   - Giant letterforms creating portal shapes
   - Negative space as the threshold
   - Reader "passes through" typography
   - Source: Propylaea of Athens + illuminated initials

2. **The Threshold Line**
   - Horizontal rule with transformation properties
   - Before (above) / After (below) differentiation
   - Source: Van Gennep's rites of passage structure

3. **The Illuminated Hook**
   - First letters of key sections decorated (gold accent)
   - Historical connection to manuscript tradition
   - Marks cognitive entry points
   - Source: Medieval illuminated manuscripts

4. **The Information Gap Bracket**
   - Typographic brackets [ ] creating space
   - The gap IS the hook visualized
   - Resolution fills the bracket
   - Source: Loewenstein's curiosity theory

5. **The Event Boundary Marker**
   - Visual signals for cognitive transitions
   - Different typography before/after doorway
   - Source: Radvansky's doorway effect research

6. **The Exordium Frame**
   - Bordered text for classical quotes
   - Frame-within-frame architectural reference
   - Source: Classical rhetoric (Cicero's vestibule metaphor)

### Motif Usage Guidelines

- **Typographic Doorway**: Major section transitions (1-2 per section maximum)
- **Threshold Line**: Minor transitions, quote separations
- **Illuminated Hook**: Opening of each major concept
- **Information Gap Bracket**: When teaching about curiosity gaps specifically
- **Event Boundary Marker**: After scroll-lock sequences
- **Exordium Frame**: Classical rhetoric quotes only (Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian)

---

## Progress Bar Concept

### Proposed Design: "The Opening Door"

**Concept**: A door icon that progressively opens as the reader advances through the essay. At 0% progress, the door is closed. At 100%, the door is fully open, revealing light (or the essay's conclusion).

**Visual Execution**:
- Fixed position on the right edge of the viewport
- Minimalist line drawing of a door
- Door angle increases proportionally with scroll progress:
  - 0%: Door closed (parallel to frame)
  - 25%: Door cracked open (15-degree angle)
  - 50%: Door half open (45-degree angle)
  - 75%: Door mostly open (70-degree angle)
  - 100%: Door fully open (90-degree angle, light emanating)

**Animation Details**:
- Smooth rotation follows scroll position
- Subtle shadow cast by door increases with angle
- At full open, golden light rays emanate (using `--gold-illumination`)
- Optional: Small threshold line beneath door

**Metaphor Alignment**:
- Door as threshold matches central metaphor perfectly
- Opening = reader crossing deeper into essay's world
- Completion = fully through the doorway, transformed
- Visual reinforces that reading is a crossing experience

**Justification**:
- Directly derived from doorway/threshold central metaphor
- Progressive revelation matches information gap concept
- Architectural element connects to propylaea research
- Unique - no other esy.com essay uses this concept

### Alternative Concept: "The Propylaea Columns"

- Vertical bar with column segments
- Each column "lights up" as section completed
- References Greek gateway architecture
- More classical, less dynamic than opening door

**Recommendation**: Primary concept (Opening Door) is stronger for its dynamism and direct metaphorical connection.

## Layout Pattern Strategy

### Recommended Patterns (minimum 3, no consecutive same)

1. **Typographic Monument** (`typographic-monument`)
   - **For**: Opening section, major threshold moments
   - **Rationale**: Typography as architecture - giant letters forming spatial experiences
   - **Subject Connection**: Propylaea-style monumental entrance

2. **Quote Exordium** (`quote-monument` variant)
   - **For**: Classical rhetoric quotes (Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian)
   - **Rationale**: Honor the rhetorical tradition with framed, weighted quotes
   - **Subject Connection**: Cicero's description of exordium as "vestibule to the oration"

3. **Information Gap Reveal** (`progressive-reveal`)
   - **For**: Sections about Loewenstein's curiosity theory
   - **Rationale**: Create visual information gaps then fill them
   - **Subject Connection**: Embodies the cognitive mechanism being taught

4. **Before/Threshold/After** (`comparison` variant)
   - **For**: Showing transformational effects of hooks
   - **Rationale**: Three-state visualization matching Van Gennep's structure
   - **Subject Connection**: Rites of passage theory (separation/liminality/reincorporation)

5. **Cognitive Diagram** (`data-viz`)
   - **For**: Working memory models, event boundary diagrams
   - **Rationale**: Technical clarity for cognitive science content
   - **Subject Connection**: Radvansky's doorway effect research visualization

6. **Standard Pedagogical** (`standard`)
   - **For**: Instructional sections, examples, explanations
   - **Rationale**: Clear hierarchical text for teaching
   - **Subject Connection**: Educational typography tradition

### Layout Distribution

| Section | Pattern | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Opening | Typographic Monument | Enter through the doorway |
| What Is a Hook? | Standard | Establish definitions |
| Information Gap Theory | Information Gap Reveal | Embody the concept |
| The Doorway Effect | Cognitive Diagram + Before/After | Radvansky visualization |
| Classical Rhetoric | Quote Exordium | Honor Cicero, Quintilian |
| Liminality | Before/Threshold/After | Van Gennep's three stages |
| Types of Hooks | Standard | Pedagogical clarity |
| Examples | Comparison | Show effective vs. weak |
| Closing | Typographic Monument | Exit transformed |

**Layout Count**: 6 different patterns
**Consecutive Same**: None

## Mobile-Native Considerations

### Mobile-First Design

**Primary Canvas**: Phone (portrait orientation)
- ~390px width (iPhone) to ~430px (larger phones)
- Full viewport height for immersive typography
- Typography must scale beautifully

**Typography for Mobile**:
- Body: 18px base (Caslon remains readable)
- Headlines: Scale proportionally (48px H1, 32px H2)
- Line height: 1.7 (generous for mobile reading)
- Letter-spacing: Slight increase for smaller sizes

**Typographic Architecture on Mobile**:
- Giant letters still form doorways but crop more dramatically
- Threshold lines remain full-width
- Information gap brackets scale proportionally
- Scroll-lock sequences remain but shorter duration (800ms)

**Touch Interactions**:
- Minimum 48x48px tap targets
- Swipe gestures for scroll-lock sequences
- Visual feedback on interaction
- No precision-required typography interactions

**Performance Budget (Mobile)**:
- Custom fonts: Max 4 weights loaded
- Web Font optimization: `font-display: swap`
- Subset fonts for used characters only
- Prefer system serif fallbacks for body if needed

### Safe Areas

- Use `100dvh` (dynamic viewport height)
- Respect `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for notches
- Fixed progress bar respects safe areas
- Typography never touches screen edges (minimum 16px margin)

---

## Accessibility Requirements

### Reduced Motion

- All doorway animations reduce to fades
- Scroll-lock sequences can be skipped immediately
- Progress bar door opening becomes static fill
- Typography transitions become instant state changes

### Screen Reader Support

- All typographic architecture has descriptive text alternatives
- Doorway metaphors explained in aria-labels
- Information gap sequences have logical text flow
- Classical quotes properly attributed with citations

### Color Contrast

- All text meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)
- Gold accent on dark background: 7.2:1 ratio
- Parchment text on manuscript dark: 8.1:1 ratio
- Reduced reliance on color alone for meaning

### Keyboard Navigation

- All scroll-lock sequences advanceable with Enter/Space
- Skip links provided for major sections
- Focus indicators highly visible (gold outline)
- Tab order follows logical reading flow

## Uniqueness Verification

### Comparison to Previous Essays

**NOT Like**:
- "The Fork" - Photorealistic, object-focused, historical narrative
- "How Money Is Created" - Technical diagrams, process-driven, dark UI aesthetic
- "The Word Dick" - Etymology timeline, historical photos, linguistic focus
- "The Silicon Revolution" - Tech industry, photography, business narrative
- "Two Visions of Tomorrow" - Dual-narrative structure, illustrative

**IS Like**:
- None - this essay's typographic-forward approach is unique in the esy.com catalog

**Unique Elements**:

| Element | Uniqueness | Subject Connection |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Typography as illustration | No other essay uses type as primary visual | Teaching writing through the medium of writing |
| Doorway progress bar | No other essay has opening door progress | Central threshold metaphor |
| Information gap reveals | No other essay creates/resolves curiosity gaps visually | Loewenstein's theory embodied |
| Before/Threshold/After structure | No other essay uses three-state liminality | Van Gennep's rites of passage |
| Gold illumination accents | No other essay uses manuscript gold tradition | Classical rhetoric connection |
| Trajan display type | No other essay uses Roman monumental inscriptions | Propylaea/rhetoric connection |

### Visual Identity Verification

This visual identity **could only exist for this specific subject** because:
1. Typography-as-architecture directly embodies the doorway/threshold metaphor
2. Color palette derives from rhetoric manuscripts and classical stone
3. Animation philosophy based on cognitive research (doorway effect, curiosity gaps)
4. Progress bar literally opens a door (the central metaphor)
5. Layout patterns match the before/liminal/after transformation structure

**Conclusion**: Visual identity is **UNIQUE** and deeply appropriate for subject matter.

*This Design Research Report establishes a unique visual identity derived entirely from subject matter research. The typographic-forward approach honors both the pedagogical tradition of teaching writing and the cognitive mechanisms that make hooks effective. Every design decision - from the Trajan display type to the opening door progress bar - connects directly to the doorway/threshold metaphor and its grounding in Loewenstein's curiosity theory, Radvansky's event boundaries, and classical rhetoric's conception of the exordium as "vestibule to the oration."*
