## Key Visualizations (5)

1. **Interactive Choropleth Map** — Water stress by region, 2000–2040 time scrubber
2. **Animated Proportional Flow Diagram** — Sankey: agriculture 70% / industrial 19% / domestic 11%
3. **Country Comparison Widget** — Israel/Jordan, Singapore/Malaysia, Australia/South Africa
4. **Scroll-Locked Explainer Sequence** — The scarcity equation (progressive diagram)
5. **Reactive Data Ticker** — 4-6 headline statistics with count-up animation

## Emotional Arc

Disorientation → Expansion (scale) → Mechanism (understanding) → Trajectory (urgency) → Agency (policy outcomes) → Reframing (design problem)

---

## Data Sources

- WRI Aqueduct (water stress index)
- FAO AQUASTAT (freshwater withdrawal by sector)
- UN Water / WHO-UNICEF JMP (population in stress)
- World Bank (infrastructure, GDP, recycling)
- IPCC AR6 (climate projections)

---

## Next Steps

1. **G2**: Complete concept research package (10 files)
2. **G3**: Create 6-layer invocation spec using Conceptual Essay Skill (with Layer 4b Data Viz Specs)
3. **G4**: Design Research (Pedagogical Lens + data visualization design)
4. **G5**: Content Implementation
5. **G6-G7**: Quality audits (Accuracy, Data Integrity, Pedagogy, Diagram Clarity)
6. **G8-G9**: Publication certification and approval
