# Key Statistics: The Geography of Water Scarcity

## Verified Statistics

### Statistic 1: "2.3 billion people live in water-stressed countries"
- **Value**: ~2.3 billion people
- **Source**: UN Water, "World Water Development Report 2023"
- **Source Tier**: Tier 1
- **Page/Table**: Executive Summary, p. 2
- **Verification**: Direct from WWDR 2023. Cross-referenced with WRI Aqueduct population-in-stress estimates.
- **Context**: This represents roughly 29% of the global population living in countries where water withdrawals exceed 25% of renewable supply.
- **Caveats**: The number varies significantly depending on the stress threshold used. Some sources cite 3.6 billion (using seasonal stress measure). Use "approximately 2.3 billion" with source citation.
- **Used In**: Data Ticker (Visual 5), opening prose
- **Last Verified**: February 2026

### Statistic 2: "Agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of global freshwater withdrawals"
- **Value**: ~70% (range: 69-72%)
- **Source**: FAO AQUASTAT; UN Water (2021)
- **Source Tier**: Tier 1
- **Page/Table**: FAO AQUASTAT database, global aggregates
- **Verification**: Cross-referenced across FAO, World Bank, UN Water. Consistent across all major sources. Regional variation: South Asia >90%, Europe ~30%.
- **Context**: Of the ~70%, the vast majority goes to irrigation. Livestock and aquaculture are smaller shares but growing.
- **Caveats**: This is a global aggregate — it masks enormous regional variation. The 70% figure is useful for establishing the overall pattern but should not be applied to individual countries.
- **Used In**: Sankey Diagram (Visual 2), Data Ticker (Visual 5)
- **Last Verified**: February 2026

### Statistic 3: "By 2030, global demand could exceed supply by 40%"
- **Value**: ~40% gap (range: 30-50% across models)
- **Source**: 2030 Water Resources Group, "Charting Our Water Future" (2009); corroborated by OECD, UN
- **Source Tier**: Tier 2 (consortium projection — widely cited but model-dependent)
- **Page/Table**: WRG 2009, p. 7 (demand-supply gap chart)
- **Verification**: The 40% figure is from a BAU (business-as-usual) scenario. OECD Environmental Outlook (2012) projects similar ranges. The direction is consistent across models even if the exact percentage varies.
- **Context**: This is a PROJECTION, not a certainty. It assumes current trends in population, agriculture, and climate continue without major intervention.
- **Caveats**: ⚠️ MUST label as projection. Include "under business-as-usual conditions." The original study is from 2009 — some conditions have changed, but the core dynamics hold.
- **Used In**: Data Ticker (Visual 5), Section 4 prose
- **Last Verified**: February 2026

### Statistic 4: "Israel recycles approximately 85% of its wastewater"
- **Value**: ~85%
- **Source**: Israel Water Authority; OECD Country Profile: Israel
- **Source Tier**: Tier 1 (government agency)
- **Page/Table**: Israel Water Authority Annual Report; OECD Environmental Performance Review: Israel (2020)
- **Verification**: Consistent across Israel Water Authority, OECD, World Bank, and academic literature. By comparison: Spain ~12%, Australia ~8%, US ~1%.
- **Context**: The world's highest recycling rate. Most recycled water goes to agricultural irrigation in the Negev desert. This single statistic is the strongest evidence for the "policy as lever" argument.
- **Caveats**: Israel's success required decades of investment, centralized water authority, and unique political circumstances. Not directly replicable everywhere without adaptation.
- **Used In**: Country Comparison (Visual 3), Section 5 prose
- **Last Verified**: February 2026

### Statistic 5: "Only 2.5% of Earth's water is freshwater"
- **Value**: 2.5% freshwater; 97.5% saline
- **Source**: USGS Water Science School; Gleick (1993), "Water in Crisis"
- **Source Tier**: Tier 1
- **Page/Table**: USGS Water Science School — "Where is Earth's Water?"
- **Verification**: Standard figure in hydrology. Further breakdown: of the 2.5%, ~69% is glaciers/ice caps, ~30% groundwater, ~1% surface freshwater.
- **Context**: This is a framing statistic — sets up the scarcity of accessible freshwater. Less than 1% of all water is readily accessible surface freshwater.
- **Caveats**: The exact percentages vary slightly by source due to measurement uncertainty, but the order of magnitude is consistent.
- **Used In**: Opening context, prose
- **Last Verified**: February 2026

### Statistic 6: "MENA region: 6% of world population, 1% of freshwater"
- **Value**: ~6% population / ~1% freshwater
- **Source**: World Bank, "Beyond Scarcity: Water Security in the Middle East and North Africa" (2018)
- **Source Tier**: Tier 1
- **Page/Table**: Executive summary, p. 1
- **Verification**: Direct from World Bank flagship report. MENA population is ~400 million of ~8 billion global.
- **Context**: The starkest population-to-water mismatch of any major region. Illustrates geographic inequality of water distribution.
- **Caveats**: "MENA" boundaries vary by definition. World Bank MENA includes 21 countries.
- **Used In**: Choropleth Map context, prose
- **Last Verified**: February 2026

### Statistic 7: "A kilogram of beef requires approximately 15,400 liters of water"
- **Value**: ~15,400 L/kg
- **Source**: Mekonnen & Hoekstra (2012), "A Global Assessment of the Water Footprint of Farm Animal Products," Ecosystems
- **Source Tier**: Tier 1 (peer-reviewed)
- **Page/Table**: Table 4 (global average water footprint by animal product)
- **Verification**: Widely cited, cross-referenced in Water Footprint Network publications. Global average; varies by production system (industrial vs. grazing).
- **Context**: Makes agricultural water demand tangible. Compare: wheat ~1,800 L/kg, rice ~2,500 L/kg, chicken ~4,300 L/kg.
- **Caveats**: Includes "green water" (rainwater on pasture) which some argue shouldn't count. The figure is most meaningful for illustrating relative proportions.
- **Used In**: Section 3 prose (making Sankey diagram data tangible)
- **Last Verified**: February 2026

### Statistic 8: "Cape Town's Day Zero crisis: dam levels dropped below 20% in 2018"
- **Value**: Dam levels <20%
- **Source**: City of Cape Town; multiple news sources; Parks et al. (2019), Nature Sustainability
- **Source Tier**: Tier 1-2
- **Page/Table**: City of Cape Town daily dam level reports (2018)
- **Verification**: Well-documented public crisis. "Day Zero" (when municipal supply would be shut off) was projected for April 2018. Averted through demand reduction to 50L/person/day.
- **Context**: The most vivid recent example of a wealthy, modern city facing acute water scarcity. Demonstrates that infrastructure alone isn't enough without demand management.
- **Caveats**: Day Zero was averted — don't present it as having happened. Use as "nearly" or "on the brink."
- **Used In**: Prose (disorientation — wealthy city on the brink)
- **Last Verified**: February 2026

## Statistics to Avoid

| Misleading Stat | Why It's Problematic | Better Alternative |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| "We'll run out of water by 20XX" | Earth doesn't "run out" of water — it cycles | "Demand will exceed sustainable supply by X%" |
| "X billion people have no water" | Conflates scarcity with lack of access; most have SOME water | "X billion live in water-stressed regions" |
| "Water consumption doubled in 50 years" | True but misleading — population also doubled | Use per-capita or stress ratio metrics |
| "X countries will face water wars" | Speculative and sensationalist | "X countries share water basins under increasing pressure" |
