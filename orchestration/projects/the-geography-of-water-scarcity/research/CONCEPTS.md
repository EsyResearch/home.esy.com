## Concept Profiles

### 1. Water Stress Index
- **Definition**: A measure of the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable freshwater supply in a given area
- **Why it matters**: It's the primary metric for quantifying scarcity — makes the invisible visible
- **Prerequisites**: Understanding that freshwater is a finite, unevenly distributed resource
- **Related concepts**: Water scarcity, water risk, baseline water stress
- **Visual representation**: Choropleth map with color scale from low stress (blue) to extreme stress (dark red/brown)
- **Key threshold**: >80% withdrawal-to-supply ratio = "extremely high" water stress (WRI)

### 2. Freshwater Allocation System
- **Definition**: The distribution of global freshwater withdrawals across three sectors: agriculture, industry, and domestic use
- **Why it matters**: Reveals that agriculture is the overwhelming consumer — the single biggest lever
- **Prerequisites**: Understanding that water has competing uses
- **Related concepts**: Virtual water, water footprint, irrigation efficiency
- **Visual representation**: Sankey/alluvial diagram showing proportional flows from total freshwater into sectors and sub-sectors
- **Key insight**: The sheer visual dominance of agriculture's share (~70%) should be viscerally obvious

### 3. The Scarcity Equation
- **Definition**: The interaction between available supply (precipitation, groundwater, surface water), demand (population, agriculture, industry), and climate reduction that produces water deficit
- **Why it matters**: It's the mechanism — understanding HOW scarcity emerges, not just WHERE
- **Prerequisites**: Water stress index, freshwater allocation system
- **Related concepts**: Demand-supply gap, renewable freshwater, groundwater depletion
- **Visual representation**: Scroll-locked progressive diagram — each scroll step adds a layer (supply → demand overlay → agricultural draw → climate reduction → resulting deficit)
- **Key insight**: Scarcity can emerge even in water-rich regions when demand exceeds renewal rate

### 4. Infrastructure & Policy as Levers
- **Definition**: Human-built systems and governance decisions that determine how efficiently water is captured, treated, distributed, and reused
- **Why it matters**: This is where the "design problem" thesis comes alive — same starting conditions, different outcomes
- **Prerequisites**: Scarcity equation (understanding that scarcity has components)
- **Related concepts**: Water recycling, desalination, drip irrigation, water pricing, governance quality
- **Visual representation**: Country comparison widget showing side-by-side metrics for curated pairs
- **Key insight**: Israel recycles ~85% of wastewater; most countries recycle <5%. This is a choice, not geography.

### 5. Water Scarcity as a Design Problem
- **Definition**: The reframing of water scarcity from natural disaster / fate to an engineering and governance challenge with identifiable levers and solvable dimensions
- **Why it matters**: This is the thesis payoff — the reader leaves with agency, not despair
- **Prerequisites**: All previous concepts — must understand the system before seeing the levers
- **Related concepts**: Systems thinking, policy intervention, infrastructure investment
- **Visual representation**: Not a single visualization — this is the conclusion the preceding visualizations collectively argue
- **Key insight**: "Not a fate to accept" — the emotional resolution of the essay

### 6. Geographic Distribution of Stress
- **Definition**: The spatial pattern of water stress across the globe — which regions face scarcity and how that pattern is changing over time
- **Why it matters**: Challenges the assumption that this is a "developing world problem" — wealthy nations face stress too
- **Prerequisites**: Water stress index
- **Related concepts**: Arid zones, semi-arid zones, water-rich regions with high demand
- **Visual representation**: Choropleth map with time scrubber (2000–2040)
- **Key insight**: The Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, but also parts of the American West, southern Europe, Australia

### 7. Demand-Supply Gap Trajectory
- **Definition**: The projected widening between global water demand and sustainable freshwater supply, measured over time
- **Why it matters**: Creates urgency — this isn't static, it's accelerating
- **Prerequisites**: Scarcity equation
- **Related concepts**: Projection, BAU scenario, climate modeling
- **Visual representation**: Time-series in the choropleth map + prose interpretation
- **Key insight**: By 2030, global demand could exceed supply by 40% under business-as-usual
