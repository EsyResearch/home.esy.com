1. Priestley's exact "happiest discovery" quote wording
2. Pemberton's morphine addiction (verified but requires sensitivity)
3. Original cocaine content estimates
4. $2,300 purchase price nuances
5. Exact New Coke duration (78 vs 79 days)
6. Woodruff "five cents" quote attribution
7. Global market size variation ($400B+ range)
