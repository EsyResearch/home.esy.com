## Quote Usage Guidelines

### For Writers

When using these quotes in the visual essay:

1. **Verified (✅)**: Use freely with attribution
2. **Attributed (⚠️)**: Use with attribution; note "attributed to" if being precise
3. **Paraphrased (P)**: Do not present as direct quote; describe as "accounts suggest" or "reportedly said"

### Quote Integration Examples

**Good** (for attributed quote):
> Robert Woodruff's wartime directive became legendary: every soldier would get a Coca-Cola for five cents, "wherever he is and whatever it costs our company."

**Better** (acknowledging attribution):
> Woodruff reportedly declared that every man in uniform would get a Coca-Cola for five cents, regardless of cost—a commitment that launched 64 bottling plants across the globe.

**Avoid** (presenting paraphrase as quote):
> Candler said "I will spend whatever it takes on advertising."
