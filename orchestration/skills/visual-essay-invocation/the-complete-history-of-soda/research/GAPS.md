# Research Gaps: The Complete History of Soda

> Research Orchestrator | January 1, 2026

## Purpose

This document identifies claims that **could not be fully verified** during research. Writers should avoid stating these as fact or should qualify them appropriately.

---

## Verified Gaps

### 1. Priestley's Exact Quote Wording

**Claim**: Priestley called carbonation his "happiest" discovery.

**Status**: ⚠️ Widely Attributed

**Issue**:
- This quote appears in many secondary sources
- Primary source (original letter or publication) not directly verified
- Exact phrasing may vary across translations/citations

**Recommendation**:
- Use: "Priestley reportedly called carbonation his 'happiest' discovery"
- Or: "According to historical accounts, Priestley considered this his 'happiest' discovery"
- Avoid presenting as verified direct quote

---

### 2. Pemberton's Morphine Addiction Details

**Claim**: Pemberton became addicted to morphine after Civil War wounds.

**Status**: ✅ Verified (multiple sources)

**Sensitivity**:
- This is historically accurate but requires careful handling
- Some sources downplay this aspect of his biography
- The addiction partly motivated his creation of patent medicines and eventual sale of Coca-Cola

**Recommendation**:
- Include factually: wounded at Battle of Columbus (April 1865), developed morphine addiction
- Note: addiction contributed to his financial desperation when selling Coca-Cola rights
- Avoid sensationalism; treat as historical context

---

### 3. Original Cocaine Content in Coca-Cola

**Claim**: Original Coca-Cola contained approximately 9 milligrams of cocaine per glass.

**Status**: ⚠️ Estimate Varies

**Issue**:
- Formula called for five ounces of coca leaf per gallon of syrup
- Candler claimed in 1891 his formula contained only one-tenth of original amount
- Exact cocaine content is estimated, not precisely documented
- Cocaine was removed in 1903

**Recommendation**:
- Use: "contained cocaine from coca leaves" (verified)
- Use: "estimated to contain several milligrams per glass" (qualified)
- Note: "exact content debated by historians"

---

### 4. $2,300 Coca-Cola Purchase Price

**Claim**: Asa Candler purchased Coca-Cola for $2,300 total.

**Status**: ✅ Verified with Nuance

**Issue**:
- The $2,300 figure is documented in Candler family biography
- Purchase was incremental: first bought one-third interest in April 1888
- Full ownership achieved by 1891
- Some sources cite slightly different total amounts

**Recommendation**:
- Use: "for a total of $2,300" (verified via son's biography)
- Avoid: implying single transaction
- Context: equivalent to approximately $64,000 in today's dollars

---

### 5. Exact Number of Days for New Coke

**Claim**: New Coke lasted 79 days (April 23 - July 11, 1985).

**Status**: ⚠️ Minor Variance

**Issue**:
- Some sources say 78 days, some say 79 days
- Depends on how you count the start and end dates
- Both April 23 launch and July 11 Classic return are verified

**Recommendation**:
- Use: "less than three months" or "approximately 79 days"
- Or: "78 days later" (conservative)
- Avoid: treating the exact number as significant to the story

---

### 6. Woodruff's "Five Cents Wherever He Is" Quote

**Claim**: Robert Woodruff declared soldiers would get Coca-Cola for five cents "wherever he is and whatever it costs our company."

**Status**: ⚠️ Widely Attributed

**Issue**:
- This quote is central to Coca-Cola's WWII narrative
- Appears in corporate history and multiple secondary sources
- Primary source (memo, speech, letter) not directly verified
- Exact phrasing may vary

**Recommendation**:
- Use with attribution: "Woodruff reportedly directed..."
- Or: "According to company history, Woodruff declared..."
- The substance of the policy is well-documented even if quote varies

---

### 7. Global Soft Drink Market Size

**Claim**: Global soft drink market is $400+ billion.

**Status**: ⚠️ Range Varies Significantly

**Issue**:
- Market research firms give widely varying estimates
- Range from $217 billion to $706 billion depending on:
  - Definition of "soft drinks" (carbonated only? All non-alcoholic?)
  - Market segments included
  - Geographic scope
  - Year of measurement

**Recommendation**:
- Use: "multi-hundred-billion-dollar industry"
- Or: "estimated at $450-630 billion globally" (with source citation)
- Avoid: claiming precision that doesn't exist
- Note: the $400B+ figure appears in multiple reports

---

### 8. 1.9 Billion Daily Coca-Cola Servings

**Claim**: More than 1.9 billion servings of Coca-Cola drinks are consumed daily.

**Status**: ✅ Verified (Corporate)

**Caveat**:
- This figure comes from The Coca-Cola Company itself
- Represents all Coca-Cola Company drinks (500+ brands), not just Coca-Cola Classic
- May include Fanta, Sprite, Dasani, Minute Maid, etc.

**Recommendation**:
- Use: "Coca-Cola Company products" (not just "Coca-Cola")
- Or: clarify: "1.9 billion servings of drinks across Coca-Cola's portfolio"
- Note: still remarkable even with this clarification

---

### 9. Kendall's "Disarming the Soviet Union" Quote

**Claim**: Donald Kendall joked to National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft: "We're disarming the Soviet Union faster than you are."

**Status**: ⚠️ Attributed

**Issue**:
- Reported in The New York Times
- Described as a "joke," implying informal context
- Primary source (direct recording) not available

**Recommendation**:
- Use with attribution: "Kendall reportedly joked..."
- Or: "According to The New York Times, Kendall quipped..."
- The submarine trade is well-documented even if quote is approximate

---

### 10. Pepsi's Exact Naval Assets

**Claim**: Pepsi acquired 17 submarines and 3 warships from the Soviet Union.

**Status**: ⚠️ Reported but Details Vary

**Issue**:
- Multiple sources confirm the submarine/warship trade
- Exact numbers (17, 3) appear in several reports
- The ships were sold for scrap, not operated as a navy
- "Sixth largest navy in the world" claim appears but seems exaggerated/humorous

**Recommendation**:
- Use: "a fleet of submarines and warships" (conservative)
- Or: "reportedly 17 submarines and 3 warships" (with attribution)
- Clarify: ships were sold for scrap, not operated
- Avoid: "sixth largest navy" claim without qualification

---

## Claims to Handle Carefully

| Topic | Issue | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Coca-Cola invention date | May 8, 1886 is specific | Use with confidence; well-documented |
| First soda fountain | Various claims | Say "among the earliest" not "the first" |
| Hilda Clark as "first" celebrity endorser | Debatable precedents exist | Say "one of the earliest" |
| Schweppes as "first" commercial soda | Other early bottlers existed | Say "among the first to achieve scale" |
| Pepsi Challenge accuracy | Scientific critiques exist | Acknowledge it was marketing, not science |

---

## What NOT to Claim

Based on research gaps, avoid these specific claims without qualification:

1. ❌ "Priestley said: [exact quote]" — use "reportedly said" or "according to"
2. ❌ "Coca-Cola contained exactly 9mg of cocaine" — use "estimated" or "several milligrams"
3. ❌ "The soft drink industry is worth exactly $X billion" — use range with source
4. ❌ "New Coke lasted exactly 79 days" — use "approximately" or "less than three months"
5. ❌ "Pepsi had the sixth largest navy in the world" — use qualified/humorous framing
6. ❌ "Woodruff said: [exact quote]" — attribute to "company history" or "reportedly"

## Acceptable Alternatives

| Instead of... | Write... |
|--------------|----------|
| "Priestley said..." | "Priestley reportedly called it his 'happiest' discovery" |
| "contained 9mg cocaine" | "contained cocaine from coca leaves; exact amount debated" |
| "$400 billion industry" | "multi-hundred-billion-dollar global industry" |
| "exactly 79 days" | "less than three months" |
| "sixth largest navy" | "a fleet of Soviet submarines and warships, later sold for scrap" |
| "1.9 billion Coca-Colas daily" | "1.9 billion servings daily across Coca-Cola Company's portfolio" |

## Impact on Visual Essay Spec

These gaps do NOT significantly impact the essay because:
- The overall narrative arc is well-supported
- Key figures are verified (even if some quotes are attributed)
- Major events are documented (1767, 1783, 1886, 1893, 1985, etc.)
- Visual assets don't depend on contested quotes
- The essay's themes are robust regardless of minor numerical precision

Writers should simply use cautious language for the flagged items.

## Sensitivity Notes

### Pemberton's Addiction
- Handle with historical accuracy, not sensationalism
- Context: Civil War veteran, wounded, common addiction pattern for era
- Relevance: explains his financial desperation and Coca-Cola's cocaine origins

### Cocaine in Early Coca-Cola
- Factually accurate; do not hide or sensationalize
- Context: coca was a common medicinal ingredient in 1886
- Note: cocaine removed in 1903, cocaine-free coca leaf extract used since 1929
- Modern Coca-Cola has no cocaine

### New Coke as "Failure"
- Goizueta reframed it as proof of brand strength
- Some argue it was net positive for Coca-Cola
- Present both the disaster and the recovery/reframing

### Cold War Pepsi
- The submarine trade is absurd but real
- Frame with appropriate historical humor
- Avoid presenting as routine business deal
