## Critical Moments for Scroll-Lock Sequences

### 1. The Publications (1932 & 1949)
- *Brave New World* arrives: 1932

- 17 years apart; World War II between them

### 2. The Spanish Wound (May 20, 1937)

- Huxley compliments *1984* but disagrees
- Predicts pleasure will prove more effective than fear
- One of literature's most prescient documents

### 5. The Deaths
- Orwell: January 21, 1950 (age 46) — tuberculosis, London
- Huxley: November 22, 1963 (age 69) — cancer, LA, LSD-assisted, same day as JFK

## Notes for Production

- The timeline should be visualized as TWO PARALLEL TRACKS that converge at the 1949 letter
- Orwell's track: Burma → Spain → BBC → Jura → Death
- Huxley's track: Eton → Blindness → California → Psychedelics → Death
- The LETTER is where the tracks cross
- Post-1985, the tracks MERGE (both visions realized)
