## Animation Timing by Era

| Era | Base Timing | Easing |
|-----|-------------|--------|

## Notes for Production

- Era transitions should be FELT, not just seen
- The split-screen should emerge organically in Era 5
- Author photographs should show their era's aesthetic
- The Letter is the visual and emotional centerpiece
- Modern imagery should feel both familiar and unsettling
