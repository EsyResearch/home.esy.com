## Purpose

This document identifies claims, questions, or areas where research was incomplete, inconclusive, or where primary sources could not be fully verified. **Items listed here should NOT be stated as fact in the visual essay without additional verification or appropriate hedging language.**

## Identified Gaps

### Gap 1: Orwell-Huxley Eton Interaction

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Claim** | Huxley taught French at Eton (1917-1919) while Eric Blair was a student there |
| **Status** | ⚠️ Partially Verified |
| **What We Know** | Both were at Eton during overlapping years; Huxley taught French briefly |
| **What We Don't Know** | Whether they ever interacted, spoke, or even met |
| **Recommendation** | State factually that they overlapped; do NOT claim they knew each other or had any meaningful interaction |
| **Hedging Language** | "Though their time at Eton overlapped, there is no evidence they interacted meaningfully" |

### Gap 2: Huxley's Letter — Physical Original

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Claim** | The letter exists as a physical artifact |
| **Status** | ⚠️ Unverified |
| **What We Know** | Letter text published in *Letters of Aldous Huxley* (1969); reproduced by Letters of Note |
| **What We Don't Know** | Current location of original; whether a scan/image exists publicly |
| **Recommendation** | Refer to letter content confidently; do NOT promise/show "the original letter" unless image is located |
| **Visual Workaround** | Recreate letter aesthetically using verified text; label as "recreation" if needed |

---

### Gap 3: *Brave New World Revisited* Exact Quotes

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Claim** | Specific quotes from *Brave New World Revisited* (1958) |
| **Status** | ⚠️ Attributed but not page-verified |
| **What We Know** | The book exists and contains Huxley's updated concerns |
| **What We Don't Know** | Exact page numbers for specific quotes |
| **Recommendation** | Verify against physical/digital copy before production; or attribute generally to the work |
| **Hedging Language** | "In *Brave New World Revisited*, Huxley wrote..." (without specific page) |

---

### Gap 4: "Room 101" BBC Origin Story

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Claim** | Room 101 in *1984* was named after a BBC conference room |
| **Status** | ⚠️ Commonly claimed, inconsistently sourced |
| **What We Know** | This claim appears in multiple sources |
| **What We Don't Know** | Primary source confirmation from Orwell himself |
| **Recommendation** | Present as widely reported, not as confirmed fact |
| **Hedging Language** | "According to BBC lore, Room 101 was named after..." |

---

### Gap 5: Exact Timing of Orwell Learning of Huxley's Response

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Claim** | Orwell read and responded to Huxley's letter |
| **Status** | ❓ Unknown |
| **What We Know** | Huxley sent the letter October 21, 1949; Orwell died January 21, 1950 |
| **What We Don't Know** | Whether Orwell responded; his reaction; if they corresponded further |
| **Recommendation** | Do NOT claim Orwell "agreed" or "disagreed" with Huxley's assessment |
| **Hedging Language** | "Orwell would die three months later; whether he responded to Huxley's letter is not recorded" |

---

### Gap 6: Contemporary Critical Reception Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Claim** | Specific reviews and reactions from 1932 (BNW) and 1949 (1984) |
| **Status** | ⚠️ Partially Verified |
| **What We Know** | Guardian reviews located; general reception noted |
| **What We Don't Know** | Full range of contemporary reviews; any negative reception |
| **Recommendation** | Can quote Guardian reviews specifically; hedge on "universal" claims |
| **Hedging Language** | "Reviews were largely positive" rather than "universally acclaimed" |

---

### Gap 7: Huxley's Exact Final Words

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Claim** | Details of Huxley's death and LSD request |
| **Status** | ⚠️ Based on Laura Huxley's account |
| **What We Know** | Laura's book *This Timeless Moment* describes the scene |
| **What We Don't Know** | Independent verification; exact timing details |
| **Recommendation** | Attribute to Laura's account |
| **Hedging Language** | "According to his wife Laura's account..." |

---

### Gap 8: Photograph Rights for NPG Images

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Claim** | National Portrait Gallery images are usable |
| **Status** | ⚠️ Rights unclear |
| **What We Know** | Images exist in NPG collection |
| **What We Don't Know** | Commercial use rights; licensing requirements |
| **Recommendation** | Use Wikimedia Commons images (verified public domain) preferentially; verify NPG rights before use |
| **Alternative** | Stick to verified public domain images (Commons) |

---

## Claims Safe to Make (Fully Verified)

The following claims have strong evidentiary support and can be stated as fact:

✅ Publication date of *Brave New World* (1932, Chatto & Windus)  
✅ Publication date of *Nineteen Eighty-Four* (June 8, 1949, Secker & Warburg)  
✅ Date of Huxley's letter to Orwell (October 21, 1949)  
✅ Orwell's death date (January 21, 1950)  
✅ Huxley's death date (November 22, 1963, same day as JFK)  
✅ Text of verified quotes from both novels  
✅ Text of verified quotes from Huxley's letter  
✅ Text of verified quotes from Postman's foreword  
✅ Orwell worked at BBC Eastern Service (1941-1943)  
✅ Orwell was shot in Spain (May 20, 1937)  
✅ Huxley moved to California (1937)  
✅ Huxley experienced near-blindness (1911)

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Use hedging language** for Gap items when they appear in essay
2. **Do not fabricate** details not found in research
3. **Attribute** where primary source is single account (e.g., Laura Huxley)
4. **Avoid overclaiming** about their relationship or interactions
5. **Prefer Commons images** over NPG until rights verified
6. **Recreate letter visually** rather than claiming to show original

## For Future Research

If time permits, these could be further investigated:

- [ ] Locate physical scan of Huxley letter
- [ ] Verify Room 101 BBC origin story with primary source
- [ ] Find additional contemporary reviews (Times Literary Supplement, New York Times, etc.)
- [ ] Clarify NPG licensing for Huxley portraits
- [ ] Locate any Orwell response to Huxley letter
