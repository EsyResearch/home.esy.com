## Supporting Figures

### Neil Postman (1931–2003)

**Neil Postman** — The Synthesizer

#### Biographical Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Birth** | March 8, 1931, New York City |
| **Death** | October 5, 2003, Flushing, New York (age 72) |
| **Education** | SUNY Fredonia, Columbia University (Ed.D.) |

#### Key Contribution

Postman's *Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business* (1985) contains the most famous direct comparison of Orwell's and Huxley's visions, arguing that Huxley's prophecy had proven more accurate in the television age.

#### Defining Quotes

> "Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think."
> — *Amusing Ourselves to Death*, Foreword

> "What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one."
> — *Amusing Ourselves to Death*, Foreword

> "Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance."
> — *Amusing Ourselves to Death*, Foreword

## Figure Relationship

### Did Orwell and Huxley Know Each Other?

- **Tenuous Connection**: Huxley briefly taught French at Eton College (1917–1919) while Eric Blair was a student there
- **No Evidence of Meaningful Interaction**: They were not known to have had personal relationship
- **The 1949 Letter**: Their only documented direct communication was Huxley's letter to Orwell after reading *1984*
- **Mutual Respect**: The letter shows Huxley admired Orwell's work while respectfully disagreeing about which dystopia was more likely

---

## Notes for Production

- All figure profiles should emphasize the **life experiences that shaped their visions**
- Orwell's journey: imperialism → fascism → propaganda → dystopia of FEAR
- Huxley's journey: privilege → blindness/perception → California/consumerism → dystopia of PLEASURE
- The biographical contrast is as important as the literary one
