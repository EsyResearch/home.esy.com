|-------|-------|
| **Quote** | "We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares. But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another — slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*." |

## Notes for Production

- The Postman passage should be quoted in FULL — it's the essay's intellectual framework
- The Huxley letter quotes are CRITICAL — this is the dramatic centerpiece
- Contrast Orwell quotes (fear, oppression) with Huxley quotes (pleasure, conditioning)
- John the Savage's "I want sin" quote is powerful for illustrating resistance to pleasure-dystopia
