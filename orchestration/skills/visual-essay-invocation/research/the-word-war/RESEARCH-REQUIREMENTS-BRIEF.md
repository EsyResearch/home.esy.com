## Project Identification

- **Working Title**: The Word War
- **Topic**: Etymology, semantic evolution, and cross-linguistic study of the English word "war"
- **Research Depth**: Deep (15-25 sources for full visual essay)

---

## Research Targets (from SKILL.md)

### 1. Figures (Layer 4)

**Target**: 5-10 key figures relevant to the word's history

Requirements per figure:
- [ ] Verified biographical information
- [ ] Connection to the word's transmission or documentation
- [ ] Available portraiture or document imagery
- [ ] Key contributions documented

**Suggested figures to research**:
- Early lexicographers who documented the word (Johnson, Webster, etc.)
- Medieval chroniclers whose texts contain early attestations
- Scholars who established the etymological pathway
- Printers/publishers of early dictionaries

### 2. Timeline/Events (Layer 4)

Requirements:
- [ ] Earliest attestations mapped chronologically (with source documents)
- [ ] Spelling stabilization milestones
- [ ] Major dictionary codifications
- [ ] Key texts containing the word (treaties, chronicles, legal documents)
- [ ] Semantic shift moments (when figurative uses emerge)

**Key dates to verify**:
- First attested use in English (OED date range)
- Norman Conquest (1066) as contact event
- Old French forms in Anglo-Norman texts
- Spelling stabilization (when *war* becomes standard)
- First figurative uses ("war on" + abstract noun)

### 3. Visual Materials (Layer 4 + 5)

Requirements:
- [ ] Manuscript pages showing early spellings
- [ ] Dictionary entries (OED, Johnson's, Webster's)
- [ ] Treaty documents or legal texts
- [ ] Maps showing language contact zones
- [ ] Era-appropriate typography samples

**Sources to search**:
- British Library digitized manuscripts
- Library of Congress
- EEBO (Early English Books Online) scans
- Wikimedia Commons (public domain)

### 4. Quotes (Layer 4)

Requirements:
- [ ] Minimum 10 verified quotes with sources
- [ ] Attribution confirmed for each
- [ ] Date and context documented

**Quote categories needed**:
- Early attestations (actual usage in texts)
- Lexicographer definitions (OED, etc.)
- Scholars on etymology
- Scholars on semantic shift
- Cross-linguistic comparisons

### 5. Etymological Data

**Core pathway to verify**:
```
Frankish *werra (reconstructed)
    → Old French werre/guerre
    → Anglo-Norman werre
    → Middle English werre/warre
    → Modern English war
```

Requirements:
- [ ] Each form attested with source and date range
- [ ] Uncertainty explicitly labeled for reconstructed forms
- [ ] OHG *werra* ("confusion, quarrel") as comparative evidence
- [ ] Phonological explanation for *g-* to *w-* variation
- [ ] Why English didn't adopt Latin *bellum*

### 6. Semantic Evolution Data

Requirements:
- [ ] Core sense: organized armed conflict (earliest attestations)
- [ ] Extensions: civil war, world war, total war (first uses)
- [ ] Figurative shift: "war on poverty" etc. (corpus evidence)
- [ ] Related terms: warfare, warrior, warmonger (formation dates)
- [ ] Collocations: "declare war," "wage war" (historical usage)

### 7. Cross-Linguistic Comparison

**Minimum 10 languages from 4+ families**:

| Language | Family | Term | Etymology | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| French | Romance | guerre | < Frankish *werra | Same source as English |
| Spanish | Romance | guerra | < Frankish *werra | Same source |
| Italian | Romance | guerra | < Frankish *werra | Same source |
| Portuguese | Romance | guerra | < Frankish *werra | Same source |
| German | Germanic | Krieg | ? | Different root |
| Dutch | Germanic | oorlog | "original decree"? | Different root |
| Russian | Slavic | voyna | ? | Research needed |
| Arabic | Semitic | harb | ? | Research needed |
| Chinese | Sino-Tibetan | zhanzheng | ? | Research needed |
| Japanese | Japonic | senso | ? | Research needed |
| Hindi | Indo-Aryan | yuddh | ? | Research needed |
| Swahili | Bantu | vita | ? | Research needed |

### 8. Disputed Areas to Document

- [ ] Exact semantic content of Frankish *werra*
- [ ] Whether "confusion" or "strife" was original sense
- [ ] Dating of figurative uses
- [ ] Relationship to Germanic cognates
- [ ] Why Romance languages borrowed Germanic term

## Special Research Notes

### On Uncertainty

The Frankish form *\*werra* is **reconstructed, not attested**. Research must:
- Clearly label this as reconstructed (asterisk notation)
- Document the evidence for reconstruction (Romance descendants, OHG cognate)
- Note scholarly consensus level
- Identify what would confirm or refute

### On Corpus Data

Corpus frequency claims must:
- Name the specific corpus used
- Note corpus limitations (OCR errors, genre skew, date range)
- Provide actual numbers or percentages
- Include "corpus bias warning" in any frequency claims

### On Cross-Linguistic Data

For each language:
- Provide the standard term for "war" (organized armed conflict)
- Note if multiple terms exist (and which is most common)
- Provide etymology or note if unknown
- Note any false friends or borrowing relationships

---

## Priority Order

1. **Etymological pathway** (forms, dates, sources) — highest priority
2. **Semantic evolution data** (meaning changes with dates)
3. **Cross-linguistic comparison** (10+ languages)
4. **Visual materials** (manuscript images, dictionary entries)
5. **Quotes** (from sources and about the word)
6. **Figures** (lexicographers, scholars)
