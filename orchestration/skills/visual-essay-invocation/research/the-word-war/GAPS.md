## Tier 2 Gaps (Medium Priority)

### 5. Pronunciation (IPA) for Historical Forms

| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Gap** | IPA transcriptions for ME, ANF, and OF forms not systematically verified |

| **Recommendation** | Present as "some scholars suggest" rather than definitive |

---

### 8. Swahili "vita" Etymology

| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | vita is of Bantu origin |
| **Source** | General knowledge; search did not return specific etymology |

---

## Tier 3 Gaps (Lower Priority)

### 10. Specific Folio for "wyrre" in Peterborough Chronicle

|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | First attestation in Peterborough Chronicle |
| **Source** | MED, OED |
| **Gap** | Specific folio number (e.g., f.35r) not confirmed |

---

### 11. Corpus Frequency Data

| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | (None made) |
| **Gap** | No corpus analysis (COCA, COHA, Google Ngrams) performed |

---

## Scholarly Debates (Unresolved)

### A. "Confusion" vs. "Strife" as Original Sense

| Debate | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Position 1** | PIE *wers- "to confuse" → original sense was "confusion" |
| **Position 2** | Germanic attestations emphasize "strife, conflict" |
| **Resolution** | None; semantic evolution may explain both |
| **Recommendation** | Present both; note PIE suggests "confusion" is older |

---

### B. Why Romance Languages Borrowed Germanic *werra*

| Debate | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Position 1** | Homophony: bellum merged with bellus "beautiful" |
| **Position 2** | Semantic: bellum described "orderly" Roman warfare |
| **Position 3** | bellum and bellus are etymologically related (de Vaan) |
| **Resolution** | Position 1 is most widely accepted |
| **Recommendation** | Lead with homophony theory; mention alternatives |

---

### C. Dating of g- to w- Sound Change in Old French

| Debate | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Issue** | When did Frankish /w/ → Old French /gw/ → /g/ occur? |
| **Gap** | Precise dating not researched |
| **Impact** | Minor; the change is well-documented if not precisely dated |
| **Recommendation** | Describe change without specific dating |

---

## Claims to Avoid

Based on the gaps above, the visual essay should **NOT** make the following claims without additional verification:

1. "The 858 CE letter is held at [specific archive]" - Location unknown
2. "*werra definitively meant 'confusion'" - Multiple meanings attested
3. "The word was first pronounced [IPA]" - Historical pronunciation uncertain
4. "Frequency of 'war' increased by X% after [date]" - No corpus analysis
5. "The Anglo-Norman Dictionary defines werre as..." - Not directly consulted
6. "de Vaan proves bellum and bellus are related" - Only cited secondarily
7. "The first use of 'wage war' was in [year]" - Date not confirmed

---

## Recommendations for the Essay

### Safe Claims (Well-Supported):
- First English attestation c.1121 in Peterborough Chronicle
- Etymology: ONF werre < Frankish *werra (reconstructed) < PGmc *werz-a-
- Romance languages borrowed from Germanic
- Homophony with bellus is leading theory for replacement of bellum
- Semantic evolution from "confusion/strife" to "armed conflict"

### Hedged Claims (Require Qualification):
- Original PIE sense "may have been" confusion
- Frankish form is "reconstructed, not directly attested"
- Scholarly debate continues on exact original meaning
- 858 CE attestation "according to the OED"

### Avoid Entirely:
- Specific pronunciation of historical forms
- Corpus frequency claims
- Direct quotes from sources not consulted (AND, de Vaan)
- Definitive dating of collocations
