## Stage-by-Stage Analysis

### 1. Proto-Indo-European (PIE)

| Attribute | Data |
|-----------|------|
| **Reconstructed Form** | *\*wers-* |
| **Meaning** | "to confuse, mix up" |
| **Status** | RECONSTRUCTED (marked with *) |
| **Source** | Watkins (via Etymonline) |
| **Confidence** | High (widely accepted) |

**Notes**: The semantic progression from "confusion" to "war" reflects conceptualization of conflict as disorder.

---

### 2. Proto-Germanic

| Attribute | Data |
|-----------|------|
| **Reconstructed Form** | *\*werz-a-* |
| **Meaning** | "to confuse, bring into confusion" |
| **Status** | RECONSTRUCTED |
| **Related Verbs** | *\*werran-* (to confuse) |
| **Source** | Etymonline, OED |

**Cognates in attested Germanic languages**:
- Old Saxon: *werran* "to confuse"
- Old High German: *werran* "to confuse"; *werra* "confusion, strife"
- Middle Dutch: *werre, warre* "disorder, confusion, unrest, strife, armed conflict, war"

---

### 3. Frankish

| Attribute | Data |
|-----------|------|
| **Reconstructed Form** | *\*werra* or *\*werru* |
| **Meaning** | "confusion; riot; quarrel; strife" |
| **Status** | RECONSTRUCTED (no direct attestation) |
| **Evidence** | Romance descendants, OHG cognate |
| **Source** | OED, Wiktionary, Etymonline |

**Critical Note**: Frankish is unattested. The form *\*werra* is reconstructed from:
1. Romance descendants (Fr. guerre, Sp./It./Pt. guerra)
2. Old High German cognate *werra*
3. Medieval Latin attestation (858 CE)

---

### 4. Medieval Latin

| Attribute | Data |
|-----------|------|
| **Attested Form** | *werra*, *werras* (plural) |
| **First Attestation** | 858 CE |
| **Context** | Episcopal letter from northeastern France |
| **Gloss** | "strifes or arguments or seditions" (vernacular term) |
| **Status** | ATTESTED |
| **Source** | OED (citing primary document) |

**Significance**: This is the earliest written record of the word in any form. The letter explicitly identifies *werras* as a vernacular (i.e., Germanic) term.

---

### 5. Old French / Old North French

| Dialect | Forms | Date Range |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Standard Old French** | guerre | c.1000-1300 |
| **Old North French** | werre, were, wiere | c.1000-1300 |

**Key Distinction**: The northern dialects (Picard, Norman, Burgundian, etc.) retained the Germanic /w/ sound, while standard Old French changed it to /gw/ → /g/.

| Attribute | Old North French |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Primary Form** | werre |
| **Variant Forms** | were, wiere |
| **Meaning** | "difficulty, dispute; hostility; fight, combat, war" |
| **Status** | ATTESTED |
| **Source** | OED, AND |

---

### 6. Anglo-Norman

| Attribute | Data |
|-----------|------|
| **Primary Form** | werre |
| **Variant Forms** | were, wiere, guerre |
| **Meaning** | "war, armed conflict" |
| **Time Period** | c.1066-1400 |
| **Status** | ATTESTED |
| **Source** | OED, Anglo-Norman Dictionary |

**Note**: Anglo-Norman was the variety of Norman French spoken in England after the Conquest. It preserved the northern /w/ forms.

---

### 7. Middle English

| Attribute | Data |
|-----------|------|
| **Primary Forms** | werre, warre |
| **First Attestation** | c.1121-1122 (entry for year 1116) |
| **Source Document** | Peterborough Chronicle (MS. Laud Misc. 636) |
| **First Scribe Form** | wyrre (possibly inverted spelling for werre) |

**Full Spelling Variant List** (from MED):
```
werre, guer, guerre, gwerre, ver, verr, verre, waar, wær,
war, ware, warr, warre, weer, weire, weore, weorre, wer,
were, werr, weyr, where, wherre, wirre, worre, berre
```

**Note on "berre"**: Listed as transmission error in manuscripts.

| Semantic Range in ME | First Attested |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Large-scale military conflict | c.1121 |
| State of hostility between persons/communities | late 12c |
| Fighting as profession ("man-of-war") | mid-14c |

---

### 8. Modern English

| Attribute | Data |
|-----------|------|
| **Standard Form** | war |
| **Spelling Standardization** | c.1500+ (with printing) |
| **Pronunciation** | /wɔːr/ (RP), /wɔr/ (GA) |
| **Status** | ATTESTED |

---

## Phonological Changes

### Germanic /w/ → Romance /gw/ → /g/

The sound change in standard Old French:

```
Frankish *w- → Old French gu- [gw] → Modern French g- [g]

Example: *werra → guerre [gɛʁ]
```

The northern dialects (Norman, Picard, etc.) **did not undergo this change**, preserving /w/:

```
Frankish *w- → Old North French w- [w]

Example: *werra → werre [wɛr(ə)]
```

This is why English has "war" (from Norman /w/) rather than *"guar" (from standard French /g/).

## Related English Words

| Word | Origin | First Attested | Etymology |
|------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **warrior** | ONF werreier | c.1300 | "one who wages war" |
| **warfare** | war + fare | implied c.1400 | Compound |
| **warmonger** | war + monger | — | Compound |
| **warlike** | war + like | — | Compound |

---

## Old English Context

**Important**: English had native words for "war" before the Norman Conquest:

| OE Word | Meaning | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **guþ** (gūþ) | "war, battle, combat" | Poetic; cognate with ON gunnr |
| **wig** | "war, battle" | Common; cognate with Ger. Krieg root? |
| **gewin** | "struggle, strife" | Usual translation of Latin bellum |
| **ingewinn** | "civil war" | Compound of in- + gewin |

The Norman French loan *werre* replaced these native terms after the Conquest.

---

## Why Germanic *werra* and Not Latin *bellum*?

The OED (1921) provides this explanation:

> "It is a curious fact that no Germanic nation in early historic times had in living use any word properly meaning 'war'... The Romanic-speaking peoples, who were obliged to avoid the Latin bellum on account of its formal coincidence with bello- beautiful, found no nearer equivalent in Germanic than werra."

### Competing Theories:

1. **Homophony Avoidance**: Latin *bellum* (war) merged phonologically with *bellus* (beautiful) in Vulgar Latin, causing confusion.

2. **Semantic Shift**: *bellum* may have described "orderly" Roman-style warfare, while *werra* captured the "confusion/disorder" of post-Roman conflict.

3. **Euphemism**: *bellum* acquired taboo associations; Germanic loanword offered neutral alternative.

**Scholarly Consensus**: Theory 1 (homophony avoidance) is most widely accepted, though de Vaan (2008) suggests *bellum* and *bellus* may share an etymology.

## Disputed or Uncertain Elements

1. **Exact semantic content of Frankish \*werra**: Sources variously gloss as "confusion," "strife," "quarrel," "riot," "tumult." The exact primary sense is unclear.

2. **Whether "confusion" or "strife" was original**: The PIE root suggests "confusion," but Germanic attestations emphasize "strife/conflict."

3. **Date of w → gu sound change**: The precise timing in Old French is debated.

4. **Relationship to OHG werra**: Whether the Frankish and OHG forms are identical or parallel developments from Proto-Germanic.
