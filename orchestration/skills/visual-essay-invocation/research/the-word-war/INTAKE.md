## Evergreen Framing (MANDATORY)

This line must appear in the essay introduction:

> *"This essay studies the history of a word, not the glamor of violence. Where scholarly views differ or evidence is incomplete, we label uncertainty and cite the best available sources."*

---

## Core Objective

Produce a comprehensive, source-disciplined, visually stunning etymology essay on the English term WAR that is:

1. **A researcher's dream**: traceable claims, primary references, corpus-aware
2. **Highly engaging for general readers**: cinematic clarity, narrative rhythm
3. **Typographically gorgeous**: world-class layout, microtypography, consistent visual identity
4. **Exotic in style but theme-relevant**: evokes manuscripts, treaties, maps, inscriptions—without turning into fantasy, kitsch, or illegibility
5. **Ethically grounded**: no glorification; treat war as a human reality and a linguistic artifact

---

## Scope Definition

### What "WAR" Means for This Essay

You are tracing:

1. **The word-form lineage** of *war* in English (spelling, pronunciation, borrowing path)
2. **The concept-lens**: how the meaning range shifted (semantic drift) from earliest attestations to modern figurative uses ("war on X")
3. **The comparative lens**: how other languages encode "war," highlighting that English *war* is not universal and is historically contingent

### What You Must NOT Do

- Do not provide operational or tactical content about conducting violence
- Do not aestheticize suffering with sensational visuals
- Do not present disputed etymologies as settled
- Do not guess dates, forms, or "first use" claims—verify them

### Three Lenses

| Lens | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Form** | Attested spellings (*werre*, *warre*, *war*), pronunciation, borrowing pathway |
| **Meaning** | Semantic drift from physical conflict to metaphorical campaigns |
| **Comparison** | How other languages carve the "war/battle/conflict" space differently |

## Required Content Modules

### A) Etymological Spine (English-focused, evidence-first)
- Earliest verifiable attestations (date ranges + source)
- Spelling variants over time (Middle English → Early Modern → Modern)
- Borrowing pathway (Old French / Anglo-Norman forms → English adoption)
- Proposed deeper origin (Germanic/Frankish hypothesis) with uncertainty handling
- Phonological notes: consonant/vowel shifts, stress patterns

### B) Semantic Evolution (meaning over time)
- Core sense: organized armed conflict
- Expansions: civil war, world war, total war; rhetorical intensifiers
- Figurative shift: "war on poverty/drugs/cancer," culture war, price war
- Euphemism and abstraction: conflict, hostilities, operations
- Moral weight: why the word carries ethical charge

### C) Morphological Productivity
- Derivatives: warfare, warrior, warlike, warmonger, warlord, warship
- Compounding patterns and productivity by era
- Collocations: "declare war," "wage war," "at war," "war footing"

### D) Contrast Set: What War Is Not
- Differentiate: war vs battle vs conflict vs feud vs riot vs genocide
- Language choice shapes perception ("war" as legal/state framing)

### E) Comparative Linguistics (Global Lens)
- At least 10 languages spanning 4+ families/regions
- Primary "war" terms with etymologies
- False friends and borrowings (*guerre*/*guerra* family vs others)

### F) Cultural-Historical Context
- How conquest, administration, law, and literature moved words
- Prestige language channels (court, church, trade, print)

### G) Disputed Areas & Scholarly Debate
- Competing hypotheses (without "winner-take-all" framing)
- What evidence would settle debates

2. Why doesn't English use a Latin root like *bellum*?
3. How did spelling/pronunciation shift across centuries?
4. How did meaning expand from armed conflict to metaphorical campaigns?
5. How do different cultures/languages carve up the "war/battle/conflict/feud" space?

## Tone & Ethical Guardrails

| Dimension | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Voice | Authoritative, calm, curious, humane |
| Ethics | Acknowledge that words are attached to lived costs |
| Framing | Avoid nationalistic or civilizational framing |
| Euphemisms | Discuss propaganda euphemisms analytically, not polemically |
| Advocacy | Avoid political advocacy; this is linguistic history with ethical awareness |

---

## Visual & Design Guardrails

### "Typographically gorgeous" means:
- Defined type scale (H1-H4, body, caption, footnote, glossary)
- Consistent baseline rhythm and generous whitespace
- Microtypography: proper quotation marks, en/em dashes, kerning-aware headings
- Clear diacritic/IPA support
- Citations that are readable and non-intrusive

### "Exotic but relevant" means:
- Evoke archival textures structurally (margins, rules, initials, map-like annotation)
- One "signature flourish" (drop cap, rubricated date markers, manuscript-style sidenotes)
- Every flourish must teach, not decorate

### Visual restraint rules:
- No battle photos
- If showing historical artifacts, use them as small, cited insets
- Documents, inscriptions, typography, maps only
