## Lexicographer Definitions

### 6. Oxford English Dictionary (1921 edition)
> "It is a curious fact that no Germanic nation in early historic times had in living use any word properly meaning 'war'. The nearest equivalent was apparently the Gothic *weihan* 'to fight'... The Romanic-speaking peoples, who were obliged to avoid the Latin *bellum* on account of its formal coincidence with *bello-* beautiful, found no nearer equivalent in Germanic than *werra*."

**Source**: OED, "war, n.1" etymology note
**Significance**: Explains why Romance languages borrowed Germanic term

---

### 7. OED Definition of "war, n.1"
> "Hostile contention by means of armed forces, carried on between nations, states, or rulers, or between parties in the same nation or state; the employment of armed forces against a foreign power, or against an opposing party in the state."

**Source**: OED Online

---

### 8. Friedrich Kluge, Etymological Dictionary of German (Krieg entry)
> "*Krieg*, masculine, 'war,' from Middle High German *kriec(g)*, masculine, 'exertion, endeavour to obtain something,' then also 'opposition, resistance, argument, discord, combat.' The predominant meaning in Modern High German is the latest, while 'counter-effort' was the earliest meaning."

**Source**: An Etymological Dictionary of the German Language (1891, trans. Wikisource)
**Significance**: Shows Germanic languages had different "war" words

---

### 9. Kluge on OHG Krieg
> "This word, obscure in origin, is shared only by Dutch (*krijg*) with German; in all the other Teutonic languages it is wanting, with Danish and Swedish *krig* being borrowed from German."

**Source**: An Etymological Dictionary of the German Language

---

## Scholarly Commentary

### 10. Etymonline (Douglas Harper) on Semantic Origin
> "The cognates suggest the original sense was 'bring into confusion.' Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian *guerra* also are from Germanic; Romanic peoples turned to Germanic for a 'war' word possibly to avoid Latin *bellum*."

**Source**: Etymonline, "war"

---

### 11. Johan Huizinga, Homo Ludens (on Dutch "oorlog")
> "The origin of the curious Dutch word for war, *oorlog*, is not altogether clear, but at any rate it belongs to the sacred or ritual sphere. The meaning of the Old Germanic words that correspond to it fluctuates between 'conflict', 'fate', and the condition of not being bound by an oath."

**Source**: Homo Ludens (1938)
**Significance**: Notes ritual/sacred dimension of Germanic war terminology

---

### 12. On the bellum/bellus Confusion
> "There was a strong trigger for the replacement of *bellum*, namely the homophony with the word for 'beautiful', in Latin *bellus*, *bella*, *bellum*. So for the stem *bell-* the meaning 'beautiful' won over 'war', and the word for war was replaced with a borrowing from Germanic."

### 13. Medieval Latin Letter (858 CE) - Paraphrase
> The vernacular word *werras* [is what] common people call "strifes or arguments or seditions."

**Source**: Episcopal letter from northeastern France, 858 CE (paraphrased in OED)
**Significance**: Earliest documentary evidence of the word

---

## Historical Observations

**Source**: Bynkershoek, 1737 (cited in constitutional scholarship)
**Significance**: Early use of "wage war" collocation

---

### 15. Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist No. 25
