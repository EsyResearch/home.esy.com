## Executive Summary

The original "Conquered Word" design (parchment, iron gall ink, Garamond typography) was rejected due to excessive similarity to the existing "the-word-pussy" essay. A radical redesign was executed: **OPERATION LEXICON**.

The new design draws from modern warfare's cold precision—military interfaces, targeting systems, radar displays, and intelligence dossiers. This is now **unmistakably distinct** from all other etymology essays in the codebase.

**Overall Reconciliation Status: PASS (Redesign)**

## Phase 4: Visual Motif Uniqueness

| Motif | Description | Exists Elsewhere? | Status |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Targeting Reticle** | Corner brackets framing key content, weapon lock aesthetic | NO | UNIQUE |
| **Coordinate Grid** | Subtle overlay transforming etymology into spatial data | NO | UNIQUE |
| **Redaction Bar** | Declassified document reveals for disputed claims | NO | UNIQUE |
| **Scan Line** | CRT/radar screen horizontal lines | NO | UNIQUE |
| **Data Stream** | Ambient scrolling coordinates in margins | NO | UNIQUE |
| **Warning Stripe** | Diagonal hazard markings (45°) | NO | UNIQUE |
| **Signal Interference** | Glitch effects for historical uncertainty | NO | UNIQUE |

**Motif Status: 7/7 UNIQUE — Zero overlap with existing essays**

---

## Phase 5: CSS Implementation Verification

All visual elements are implementable using standard CSS:

- **Targeting reticle**: `::before`/`::after` pseudo-elements with borders
- **Coordinate grid**: CSS linear-gradient background
- **Scan lines**: Repeating linear gradient overlay
- **Radar sweep**: CSS animation with transform rotation
- **Warning stripe**: Repeating linear gradient at 45°
- **Redaction system**: `background`/`color` matching with `:hover` reveal

**Implementation Status: PASS — All elements CSS-native**
