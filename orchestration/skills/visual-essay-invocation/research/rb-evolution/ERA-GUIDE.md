In the 1940s, R&B music exploded in urban centers like New York, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles.

The term "rhythm and blues" was coined by **Jerry Wexler**, a writer for Billboard magazine, in 1949 to replace the term "Race Music" (which had been in use since 1920). The Billboard chart name was officially changed in the magazine's June 17, 1949 issue.
