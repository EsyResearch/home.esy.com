# Visual Assets: Etymology of "Pussy"

## Visual Treatment Philosophy

This is a **typography-forward** visual essay where **letterforms and historical documents** are the primary visual elements. Photography of people is minimal; photography of *things* (manuscripts, dictionaries, type specimens) is primary.
