# Research Gaps: Etymology of "Pussy"

## Overview

This document identifies claims that could NOT be fully verified, areas of scholarly debate, and limitations of available sources.

---

## Gap 1: Exact Old Norse Connection

### The Claim
The anatomical meaning derives from Old Norse *pūss* (pocket/purse).

### Status: UNCERTAIN

**What We Know**:
- Old Norse *pūss* and Old English *pusa* mean "pocket/bag/purse"
- Low German *puse* was used for vulva
- The metaphor (container → anatomy) is plausible

**What We Don't Know**:
- Whether the anatomical meaning was borrowed directly from Norse
- Or whether it developed independently in English through metaphor
- The exact timeline of when this meaning emerged in English

**Recommendation**: Present this as *one possible etymology* rather than definitive fact.

---

## Gap 2: Pre-1533 English Usage

### The Claim
The word may have existed in English before 1533.

### Status: UNDOCUMENTED

**What We Know**:
- 1533 is the first *written* attestation
- Oral usage almost certainly preceded written documentation

**What We Don't Know**:
- How long the word was used orally before being written
- Whether earlier written examples exist in undiscovered manuscripts

**Recommendation**: Use "first documented" rather than "first use."

---

## Gap 3: The Cat-to-Woman Transition Mechanism

### The Claim
"Pussy" was applied to women because of perceived cat-like qualities (softness, sweetness).

### Status: SCHOLARLY INFERENCE

**What We Know**:
- Stubbes documents the feminine usage in 1583
- The association with softness/affection makes intuitive sense

**What We Don't Know**:
- Exactly when and how this transition happened
- Whether it was a deliberate euphemism or organic metaphor

**Recommendation**: Present as likely explanation, not proven mechanism.

---

## Gap 4: Exact Date of Vulgar Meaning Emergence

### The Claim
The anatomical meaning emerged in the "17th century."

### Status: APPROXIMATE

**What We Know**:
- Cotton's 1664 usage shows it was established by then
- Scholarly sources cite "17th century" broadly

**What We Don't Know**:
- The earliest written example of the explicit anatomical meaning
- Whether the meaning emerged early or late in the century

**Recommendation**: Use "by the mid-17th century" as a hedge.

---

## Gap 5: "Pusillanimous" False Etymology

### The Claim
Some claim "pussy" (coward) derives from Latin *pusillanimous*.

### Status: DEBUNKED

**What We Know**:
- This is a common folk etymology
- Scholarly consensus rejects this connection
- The "coward" meaning clearly derives from the anatomical/feminine meaning

**What We Don't Know**: N/A

**Recommendation**: May be worth mentioning as a "common misconception" if appropriate.

---

## Gap 6: Cross-Cultural Cognates

### The Claim
Similar words exist in many languages (Lithuanian *puižė*, Irish *puisín*).

### Status: DOCUMENTED BUT RELATIONSHIP UNCLEAR

**What We Know**:
- These cognates exist
- They're used to call cats

**What We Don't Know**:
- Whether they share a common proto-origin
- Or whether they developed independently as onomatopoeia

**Recommendation**: Mention as interesting parallels, not proven relatives.

## Gaps Summary Table

| Gap | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----|--------|------------|
| Old Norse exact connection | MEDIUM | Present as possibility |
| Pre-1533 usage | LOW | Say "first documented" |
| Cat-to-woman mechanism | MEDIUM | Present as inference |
| Exact vulgar emergence date | LOW | Say "by mid-17th century" |
| Pusillanimous claim | LOW | Could debunk as misconception |
| Cross-cultural cognates | LOW | Note as parallels |

## Claims to AVOID Making

Based on these gaps, the visual essay should NOT claim:

1. ❌ "The word definitely comes from Old Norse *pūss*"
2. ❌ "The first use was in 1533" (say "first documented")
3. ❌ "The vulgar meaning appeared in [specific year]"
4. ❌ Any claim about the word's usage before 1533
5. ❌ Any definitive claim about why cats were called "puss"

---

## Claims That ARE Well-Supported

1. ✅ The word is documented in English from 1533
2. ✅ Philip Stubbes noted feminine usage in 1583
3. ✅ Charles Cotton used the double meaning in 1664
4. ✅ Samuel Johnson omitted the word in 1755
5. ✅ The "coward" meaning is a 20th-century American innovation
6. ✅ The word demonstrates euphemism treadmill and semantic shift
7. ✅ Etymology involves both Germanic feline roots and possible Norse "pocket" roots
