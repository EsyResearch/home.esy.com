## Visual Transition Philosophy

The essay should **morph** between eras:

- Colors shift from warm/ancient to cold/modern
- Textures transition from organic (parchment) to digital (pixels)
- The word's visual representation tells the story of its journey

### Scroll-Driven Era Transitions

|---------|-----|----------------------|
| Hero | All | Word rendered in ALL type styles simultaneously |
| Origins | Medieval | Blackletter emerges, ancient mystery |
| First Uses | Renaissance | Blackletter morphs to Humanist |
| Dual Meaning | Restoration | Humanist to Transitional |
| Victorian Split | Victorian | Modern/Didone, split screen innocent/shadow |
| American Shift | Modern | Sans-serif, stark, censored |
| Today | Digital | The word as cultural object |
