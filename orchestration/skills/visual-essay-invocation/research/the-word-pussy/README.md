## Key Findings

### Three Distinct Etymology Branches

1. **Feline Branch** (16th century): From Germanic *puss*/*poes* meaning "cat"
2. **Anatomical Branch** (17th century): Possibly from Old Norse *pūss* ("pocket/purse") 
3. **Cowardice Branch** (20th century): American slang evolution from feminine associations

### Central Thesis

A single word accumulated wildly different meanings through the mechanisms of affection, metaphor, and taboo—demonstrating how language is shaped by cultural attitudes, euphemism cycles, and semantic drift.
