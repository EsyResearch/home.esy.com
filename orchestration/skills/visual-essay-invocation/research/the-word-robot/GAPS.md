# Research Gaps: ROBOT — The Word That Imagined Our Future

> Generated: December 12, 2025
> Purpose: Document what could NOT be verified or fully sourced

---

## Critical Gaps (Affect Core Narrative)

### Gap 1: Primary Czech Source for Josef Čapek's Suggestion
**What We Know**: Karel Čapek credited Josef with suggesting "robot" over "labori"
**What We Don't Have**: Original letter or document where Josef made the suggestion
**Best Available**: Karel's later newspaper column recounting the story (secondary)
**Recommendation**: Present as attributed/recounted, not primary witness
**Impact**: LOW — Story is well-established, just lacks primary document

### Gap 2: Exact First Use in English
**What We Know**: R.U.R. translated to English 1923, word spread
**What We Don't Have**: Definitive "first use in English" citation
**Best Available**: OED entry for "robot" with earliest cited uses
**Recommendation**: Reference OED as authority, avoid claiming specific "first"
**Impact**: LOW — General timeline is clear

### Gap 3: Original Mori 1970 Essay in English
**What We Know**: Mori proposed uncanny valley in 1970 Energy magazine
**What We Don't Have**: Full original Japanese text with verified translation
**Best Available**: IEEE Robotics & Automation 2012 official translation
**Recommendation**: Use 2012 translation, note it's official but not contemporaneous
**Impact**: LOW — Concept is well-documented

---

## Moderate Gaps (Limit Depth)

### Gap 4: Quantitative Public Perception Data Pre-1990s
**What We Need**: Survey data on robot attitudes before Pew studies
**What We Have**: Qualitative cultural analysis, film reception, news coverage
**Best Available**: Academic analyses of media representation as proxy
**Recommendation**: Use cultural evidence (films, articles) as perception indicators
**Impact**: MEDIUM — Limits quantitative claims for earlier eras

### Gap 5: Czech Audience Reaction to R.U.R. Premiere
**What We Need**: Contemporary 1921 reviews, audience accounts
**What We Have**: General success noted in biographies
**Best Available**: Czech literary history sources (may need translation)
**Recommendation**: Reference general success, avoid specific audience quotes
**Impact**: LOW — Not critical to word origin story

### Gap 6: Worker Ethnographies of Robot Coexistence
**What We Need**: First-person accounts of factory workers with robot colleagues
**What We Have**: Surveys about job displacement fears (abstract)
**Best Available**: Occasional journalistic pieces, not systematic studies
**Recommendation**: Focus on survey data rather than personal narratives
**Impact**: MEDIUM — Limits emotional depth on labor angle

### Gap 7: Non-Western Robot Etymology Research
**What We Need**: How "robot" was adopted/adapted in Japanese, Chinese, Korean
**What We Have**: General knowledge that concepts differ culturally
**Best Available**: Academic papers on Japanese robot culture
**Recommendation**: Note cultural differences exist, don't overclaim specifics
**Impact**: MEDIUM — Limits comparative analysis

---

## Minor Gaps (Polish Issues)

### Gap 8: Josef Čapek Visual Art Depicting Robots
**What We Need**: Paintings or illustrations by Josef specifically of robots
**What We Have**: General knowledge of his Cubist work
**Best Available**: Czech National Gallery archives
**Recommendation**: Use portrait photos rather than claim robot-specific art
**Impact**: LOW — Visual alternatives exist

### Gap 9: Typography Specimens from Original R.U.R.
**What We Need**: Actual font used in 1920s R.U.R. programs/posters
**What We Have**: Era-appropriate fonts we can use
**Recommendation**: Use period-authentic alternatives, don't claim exact match
**Impact**: LOW — Era authenticity more important than exact match

### Gap 10: Asimov's Original Handwritten Notes
**What We Need**: Manuscript showing Three Laws development
**What We Have**: Published stories with laws fully formed
**Recommendation**: Reference published work as authoritative
**Impact**: NONE — Published work is the primary source

---

## Areas of Scholarly Debate

### Debate 1: Were R.U.R. Robots Mechanical or Biological?
**Issue**: Play describes them as assembled biological beings, not metal machines
**Our Position**: Present the play's actual description, note common misconception
**Sources Conflict**: Popular understanding vs. play text
**Recommendation**: Quote play text directly, correct common assumption

### Debate 2: Who "Really" Invented the Word?
**Issue**: Josef suggested it, Karel used it—who gets credit?
**Our Position**: Both brothers, with Josef credited for the specific word
**Recommendation**: Present as collaborative, per Karel's own account

### Debate 3: Uncanny Valley Validity
**Issue**: Some researchers question Mori's valley as universal phenomenon
**Our Position**: Present as influential theory, not proven law
**Recommendation**: Describe as "proposed" or "influential concept"

## Claims to Avoid

Based on research gaps, avoid these unsupported claims:

| Avoid Claiming | Why | Alternative |
|----------------|-----|-------------|
| "The first time anyone used 'robot'" | Can't verify absolute first | "Čapek introduced 'robot' in R.U.R." |
| "Audiences were terrified" at R.U.R. | No specific evidence | "The play was a sensation" |
| "70% of people feared robots in 1960" | No survey data | "Automation anxiety grew as factories..." |
| "Mori proved the uncanny valley" | Theory, not proven law | "Mori proposed the concept of..." |
| "Japanese love robots more than Westerners" | Oversimplification | "Cultural attitudes toward robots differ..." |
| "The Terminator made everyone fear robots" | Overstatement | "The Terminator crystallized fears of..." |

## Research Extension Opportunities

If deeper research becomes possible:

1. **Czech National Archives** — Original R.U.R. documents, Čapek papers
2. **Japanese robotics archives** — Pre-uncanny valley research, cultural context
3. **Labor history archives** — 1960s-80s automation debates, union records
4. **Film studio archives** — Audience research for Terminator, Blade Runner
5. **Survey research organizations** — Pre-1990s opinion polling on technology
