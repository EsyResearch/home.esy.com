## Primary Research Questions

1. **Etymology & Birth**: What is the precise origin of the word "robot," and how did Karel and Josef Čapek create/select it for R.U.R.?

2. **Semantic Evolution**: How has the meaning and connotation of "robot" shifted from 1920 to present—from theatrical metaphor to technological reality?

3. **Public Perception Arc**: How has public sentiment toward the concept of "robot" evolved across cultural, generational, and technological changes?

## Secondary Research Questions

### Supporting Primary 1 (Etymology & Birth):
- What does "robota" mean in Czech/Slovak, and what are its feudal labor connotations?
- What was Karel Čapek's original word choice ("labori"), and why did Josef suggest "robot" instead?
- How did R.U.R. frame the robots—as mechanical beings or biological constructs?
- When and how did "robot" enter English and other major languages?
- What dictionaries first included "robot," and how did they define it?

### Supporting Primary 2 (Semantic Evolution):
- How did early definitions of "robot" differ from modern definitions?
- When did "robot" become associated with mechanical/electronic beings vs. artificial biological workers?
- How has the boundary between "robot," "automaton," "android," and "AI" shifted?
- What role did science fiction (Asimov, Blade Runner, Terminator) play in reshaping the word's meaning?
- How do different languages/cultures use robot-related terminology differently?

### Supporting Primary 3 (Public Perception):
- What were initial public reactions to R.U.R. and the robot concept?
- How did industrial automation (1960s-80s) affect public sentiment?
- What cultural moments triggered fear vs. acceptance of robots?
- How do surveys track public attitudes toward robots/automation over time?
- How has the AI moment (2020s) affected the word "robot" and its associations?

## Exploratory Questions

- How do children's media (WALL-E, Big Hero 6) shape positive robot perception?
- Are there cultural differences in robot acceptance (Japan vs. Western nations)?
- How has the robotics industry tried to rebrand/reframe the term?
- What is the "uncanny valley" and how does it affect robot acceptance?
- How do workers who interact with industrial robots perceive the term?
- Is there a generational divide in robot perception?

## Hypotheses

### Strong (High Confidence)
- **The word "robot" was chosen for its labor/servitude connotation**: Josef Čapek's suggestion was deliberate—"robota" (forced labor) captured the play's theme of artificial workers rising against masters.
- **Science fiction dominated robot perception for 50+ years**: Before real robots existed, science fiction defined public imagination of what robots are and could become.

### Working (Test Thoroughly)
- **Industrial automation triggered the first major fear cycle**: The introduction of factory robots (1960s-80s) caused significant public anxiety about job displacement.
- **Roomba and consumer robots shifted perception toward benign helpers**: Affordable, friendly home robots changed the emotional valence of "robot" for many people.
- **The AI moment is expanding "robot" beyond physical machines**: ChatGPT and AI assistants are being colloquially called "robots" despite being software.

### Speculative (Investigate Cautiously)
- **Cultural attitudes toward work affect robot perception**: Societies with different work cultures (Japanese vs. American) may have fundamentally different relationships with the concept.
- **Typography and visual design of "robot" in media may have reinforced meanings**: How the word is displayed (mechanical fonts, retro-futurism) may shape perception.

## Scope Definition

### Included
- Origin story: Karel and Josef Čapek, R.U.R., Czech etymology
- Time period: 1920–2025 (full century)
- Geographic focus: Global, with emphasis on English-speaking world + Czech origins + Japanese contrast
- Semantic evolution: How the word's meaning has shifted
- Cultural representations: Film, TV, literature, advertising
- Public sentiment: Fear, fascination, acceptance, anxiety cycles
- Typography and visual representation of robots through eras
- Key figures: Čapeks, Asimov, Engelberger, Mori, contemporary roboticists

### Excluded

### Depth Expectations
- **Etymology**: Deep—primary sources on Čapek brothers, original play text
- **Timeline 1920-1960**: Moderate—key cultural moments
- **Industrial robots 1960-1990**: Moderate—labor impact, perception shifts
- **Consumer robots 1999-present**: Moderate—AIBO, Roomba, social robots
- **Current AI moment**: Moderate—how it affects "robot" concept
- **Typography/visual treatment**: Research-supported—era-appropriate fonts identified

## Research Priorities

| Priority | Focus Area | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Etymology and R.U.R. origin | Foundation of entire essay—must be rock-solid |
| 2 | Key figures with verified quotes | Čapeks, Asimov need authenticated statements |
| 3 | Public perception data over time | Need surveys, studies, or historical evidence |
| 4 | Visual archive sources by era | Photography for photo essay treatment |
| 5 | Typography specimens | Era-appropriate fonts for design research |
| 6 | Contemporary robot sentiment | Current context for reader relevance |

## Known Gaps

- **Primary Čapek sources in English translation quality**: Original Czech sources may be more authoritative
- **Quantitative perception surveys before 1990s**: May be scarce; rely on media analysis instead
- **Typography specimens**: May need design history sources, not just robotics sources
- **Non-Western robot etymology**: Japanese, Korean, Chinese adoption of robot concepts may have different trajectories
- **Worker interviews/ethnographies**: First-person accounts of working alongside robots may be limited
