# Research Gaps: Gaza-Israel Wars & Present (2007-Today)

> **Module**: 12-present
> **Last Updated**: December 23, 2024
> **ACTIVE CONFLICT: Enhanced documentation required**

---

## Tier 1: Do Not Claim (Insufficient Evidence / Unverifiable)

### October 7 Attack
1. **Precise breakdown of civilian vs. combatant deaths** — Initial claims conflated; not fully verified
2. **Specific perpetrators of specific atrocities** — Hamas vs. other armed groups vs. chaos
3. **Israeli "Hannibal Directive" claims** — Some Israeli sources allege IDF fire killed hostages; contested, under investigation
4. **Full scope of sexual violence** — UN documented cases; scale disputed; verification ongoing

### Gaza War (2023-Present)
1. **Precise combatant vs. civilian ratio** — Gaza Ministry provides totals; Israel disputes ratio; independent verification impossible
2. **Intent determinations** — Whether specific strikes constitute war crimes requires legal determination
3. **"Genocide" determination** — ICJ case ongoing; provisional measures ≠ finding of genocide
4. **Tunnel network extent** — Military claims cannot be independently verified
5. **Aid diversion claims** — Israel alleges Hamas diverts aid; extent unverifiable

### Political
1. **Netanyahu's prior knowledge** — Allegations of intelligence failures; investigations ongoing
2. **Hamas decision-making** — Internal deliberations not accessible
3. **Post-war plans** — No verified commitments from any party

## Tier 2: Scholarly/Expert Debate

### Gaza Blockade
1. **Blockade as "collective punishment"**
   - Position A: Blockade is collective punishment (UN, human rights orgs, international law scholars)
   - Position B: Blockade is legitimate security measure (Israel, some legal scholars)
   - Esy Approach: Present both; note UN/human rights consensus leans toward collective punishment

2. **Hamas governance**
   - Position A: Hamas is terrorist organization that oppresses Gazans
   - Position B: Hamas is resistance movement with legitimate grievances; won 2006 election
   - Position C: Hamas is both — elected, provides services, but also authoritarian and violent
   - Esy Approach: Present complexity; note terror designation status varies by country

### October 7
3. **October 7 as "unprovoked"**
   - Position A: Attack was unprovoked terrorist massacre
   - Position B: Attack occurred in context of 16-year blockade and occupation
   - Esy Approach: Attack was war crime; context does not justify; both can be stated

4. **Scale comparisons**
   - "Deadliest day for Jews since Holocaust" — Verified by death toll
   - "Proportionality" debates — International humanitarian law interpretive debates
   - Esy Approach: State verified facts; note IHL debates are legal questions

### Gaza Response
5. **"Self-defense" scope**
   - Position A: Israel's military response is legitimate self-defense
   - Position B: Scale and conduct exceed self-defense; constitute collective punishment
   - Esy Approach: Note both positions; cite IHL experts on proportionality debates

6. **Famine determination**
   - Position A: Famine conditions exist (IPC, UN humanitarian reports)
   - Position B: Israel allows sufficient aid; Hamas diverts it
   - Esy Approach: Cite UN/IPC findings; note access restrictions; note dispute

---

## Tier 3: Politically Contested (Facts Clear, Politics Disputed)

### Gaza Casualties
1. **Gaza Health Ministry figures**
   - Historical accuracy: UN/WHO consider historically reliable
   - Current controversy: Israel disputes combatant ratio
   - Esy Approach: Use figures with attribution ("per Gaza Health Ministry, verified by UN")

### Two-State Solution
2. **Viability of two-state solution**
   - Israeli right: One state with Israeli sovereignty
   - Palestinian position: Two states on 1967 lines
   - International consensus: Two states, though "dying"
   - Esy Approach: Note settlement expansion complicates; present positions

### Terminology
3. **"Terrorism" vs. "resistance"**
   - Western/Israeli: Hamas is terrorist organization
   - Some Arab/Palestinian: Armed resistance to occupation
   - Esy Approach: Use "Hamas-led attack"; note designations vary

4. **"Genocide" language**
   - Proponents: ICJ case, scale of destruction, statements by Israeli officials
   - Opponents: No intent proven; war crimes ≠ genocide; case ongoing
   - Esy Approach: Note ICJ case and provisional measures; do not adjudicate

## Active Conflict Verification Limitations

### What CAN Be Documented
| Category | Sources | Confidence |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Death tolls | Gaza Ministry + UN verification | Medium-High |
| Displacement | UNRWA | High |
| Physical destruction | Satellite imagery | High |
| Aid access | UN humanitarian reports | High |
| Legal proceedings | ICJ/ICC documents | High |
| Hostage numbers | Israeli government | High (for known) |

### What CANNOT Be Documented Definitively
| Category | Limitation | Approach |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Combatant vs. civilian | No independent access | State as gap |
| Military decision-making | Classified/unreleased | Do not speculate |
| Full hostage status | Some unknown | State known numbers |
| Hamas casualties | Not released/verified | Note as unknown |
| Intent | Legal determination required | Do not claim |
| Final outcomes | Conflict ongoing | Date-stamp all claims |

## Narrative Framing Risks

### Risk 1: "Both sides" false equivalence
- **Risk**: Treating state military and non-state militants as equivalent
- **Mitigation**: Note power asymmetry; document civilian impacts on both; don't equate legal obligations

### Risk 2: Casualty number comparisons
- **Risk**: Using ratio to imply moral equivalence or its opposite
- **Mitigation**: Report numbers factually; note verification challenges; avoid interpretive framing

### Risk 3: Historical context as justification
- **Risk**: Context can be read as excuse for war crimes
- **Mitigation**: Context explains, doesn't justify; state clearly that attacks on civilians are war crimes regardless of context

### Risk 4: Terminology as positioning
- **Risk**: "Genocide," "terrorism," "resistance" are politically charged
- **Mitigation**: Use descriptive language; note where terms are contested; cite legal proceedings where applicable

### Risk 5: Recency bias
- **Risk**: October 7 and aftermath may dominate, obscuring pre-existing conditions
- **Mitigation**: Document blockade, settlement expansion, PA governance failures before October 7

## Terminology Guidance

| Term | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Hamas | Name the organization; note terror designations vary by country |
| October 7 attack | "Hamas-led attack on southern Israel" |
| Gaza war | "Israel's military operation in Gaza" or "Gaza war" |
| Genocide | "ICJ genocide case" or "genocide allegations" — do not adjudicate |
| Terrorism | Describe specific actions; note term is contested |
| Blockade | Use term; document impacts; note Israeli security rationale |
| Occupation | Use for West Bank; Gaza status debated (Israel says ended 2005; UN says continues via control) |
| Hostages | Israeli term; use for those taken October 7 |
| Prisoners | Palestinian term for those in Israeli detention |
| Ceasefire | Use as diplomatic term; note conditions disputed |

## Key Principle for This Module

**This is an active conflict with verification limits.**

We can document:
- What happened (events, casualties, destruction)
- What international bodies have said (UN, ICJ, ICC)
- What positions exist (Israeli, Palestinian, international)

We cannot adjudicate:
- Legal determinations (genocide, war crimes pending trials)
- Intent (requires evidence beyond current access)
- Outcomes (conflict ongoing)

**Date-stamp everything. Update as verified information emerges.**

---

## Module Status

This module requires ongoing updates as:
- Conflict continues
- Investigations conclude
- Legal proceedings advance
- Verified information emerges

All claims current as of December 2024.
