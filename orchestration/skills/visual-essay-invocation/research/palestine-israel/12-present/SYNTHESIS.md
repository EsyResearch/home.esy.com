## Executive Summary

Since 2007, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been characterized by: Gaza's isolation under blockade; periodic devastating wars; West Bank settlement expansion; diplomatic stalemate; and the erosion of the two-state framework. The October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and Israel's subsequent military operation in Gaza represent a catastrophic escalation with unprecedented civilian casualties and destruction. As of December 2024, the conflict continues with no clear resolution.

## Core Thesis

**The two-state solution has been dying.** Settlements have expanded relentlessly. Gaza has been blockaded and repeatedly devastated. Palestinian Authority controls shrinking territory. Hamas and Israel have fought multiple wars with no political resolution. October 7, 2023 and its aftermath may represent a point of no return — or a crisis that forces new thinking.

## Gaza Under Blockade (2007-2023)

### The Blockade

**Since 2007**:
- Israel and Egypt control all entry/exit
- Restrictions on goods, movement, exports
- Fishing zone limited
- "Open-air prison" characterization
- Periodic "mowing the grass" operations

### Gaza Wars

| War | Dates | Gaza Dead | Israeli Dead | Trigger |
|-----|-------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Cast Lead | Dec 2008-Jan 2009 | ~1,400 | 13 | Rockets |
| Pillar of Defense | Nov 2012 | ~170 | 6 | Rockets |
| Protective Edge | July-Aug 2014 | ~2,200 | 73 | Kidnapping/rockets |
| 2021 | May 2021 | ~250 | 13 | Jerusalem/Sheikh Jarrah |

### Humanitarian Conditions

Pre-October 2023:
- Unemployment: ~45%
- Youth unemployment: ~60%
- Water: 96% unfit to drink
- Power: 4-8 hours/day
- UN: "Unlivable" by 2020

## West Bank Developments

### Settlement Expansion

| Year | Settler Population |
|------|-------------------|
| 2007 | ~280,000 |
| 2015 | ~400,000 |
| 2023 | ~500,000+ (West Bank proper) |
| E. Jerusalem | ~230,000 additional |

### Palestinian Authority

- Controls Area A (shrinking)
- Security coordination with Israel (controversial)
- Abbas: No elections since 2006
- Legitimacy crisis
- West Bank raids increased

## October 7, 2023 and Aftermath

### The Attack (October 7, 2023)

**What happened** (verified):
- Hamas-led attack on southern Israel
- ~1,200 people killed (revised from initial 1,400)
- ~240 hostages taken
- Kibbutzim, towns, music festival attacked
- Deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust

**Israeli Response**:
- Declared war on Hamas
- Massive air campaign on Gaza
- Ground invasion (October 27)
- Stated goal: Destroy Hamas; free hostages

### Gaza Casualties (as of December 2024)

**Per Gaza Health Ministry** (numbers contested):
- 40,000+ killed (majority women/children per UN)
- 90,000+ injured
- 1.9 million displaced (nearly entire population)
- 60%+ of buildings damaged/destroyed

**Verification challenges**:
- Independent verification limited
- Hamas Ministry figures historically roughly accurate per UN
- Israel disputes militant vs. civilian ratio

### International Response

- UN: Calls for ceasefire (US vetoed multiple)
- ICJ: Genocide case filed by South Africa (ongoing)
- ICC: Arrest warrant applications for Israeli and Hamas leaders
- Humanitarian organizations: Catastrophe; famine risk

## Key Findings (with Active Conflict Caveats)

1. **Gaza blockade created humanitarian crisis** (pre-2023)
2. **October 7 was catastrophic attack on Israeli civilians** (verified)
3. **Israeli response has caused massive civilian casualties** (UN verified)
4. **Scale of destruction is unprecedented** (satellite imagery, UN)
5. **Long-term political resolution remains absent**

---

## Active Conflict Limitations

**What we can document**:
- Death tolls (with caveats about verification)
- Physical destruction (satellite imagery)
- Displacement numbers (UN/UNRWA)
- International legal proceedings (ICC/ICJ)

**What we cannot document definitively**:
- Precise civilian vs. combatant ratios
- Intent and decision-making
- Full scope of events (fog of war)
- Final outcomes (conflict ongoing)
