## Executive Summary

Ottoman Palestine (1516-1917) was a region within a vast multi-ethnic empire, not a distinct political entity. Over four centuries, it was administered through changing provincial structures, governed by Islamic law with the millet system providing community autonomy for non-Muslims. The population was predominantly Arab Muslim, with significant Christian and smaller Jewish minorities. The 19th century brought modernization, European intervention, and the seeds of both Arab and Jewish nationalisms. By 1914, the population was approximately 700,000-800,000, with about 60,000 Jews (roughly 8-10%).

**Critical finding**: Ottoman Palestine was neither an independent state nor a completely barren land. It was a functioning agricultural society with established communities, religious diversity, and local political structures — though increasingly affected by European influence and nascent nationalisms.

## Core Thesis

**Four centuries of empire, then transformation.** Ottoman Palestine was a region, not a country. Its borders shifted, its administrative status changed, and it was always part of something larger. But the land was inhabited, cultivated, and governed. The people who lived there — mostly Arabic-speaking Muslims, with Christian and Jewish minorities — would become the Palestinians of the 20th century. At the same time, the 19th century brought forces (European imperialism, modernization, nationalism) that would transform everything.

### Early Administrative Structure

| Unit | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Eyalet of Damascus | Larger province containing Palestine |
| Sanjak of Jerusalem | District covering southern highlands |
| Sanjak of Nablus | District covering central highlands |

---

## 18th Century: Decentralization

### Local Strongmen

As Ottoman central control weakened:

**Zahir al-Umar (~1730-1775)**:
- Arab ruler who dominated Galilee
- Rebuilt Acre; encouraged trade
- Invited Jews to settle in Tiberias
- Eventually crushed by Ottomans

**Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar (1775-1804)**:
- "The Butcher" — ruthless but effective
- Governor of Acre
- Defeated Napoleon at Acre (1799)
- Restored order after Zahir

### Napoleon's Invasion (1799)

- French expedition to Egypt (1798)
- Napoleon invaded Palestine (1799)
- Siege of Acre: Defeated by al-Jazzar with British help
- French withdrawal; but signal of European interest

---

## Egyptian Interlude (1831-1840)

### Muhammad Ali's Rule

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Conquest | Ibrahim Pasha (son) conquered Syria and Palestine |
| Reforms | Modernization; conscription; tax reform |
| Christian status | Improved; equality with Muslims |
| Rebellion | Peasant revolts against conscription, taxes |
| Outcome | European intervention; Ottomans restored |

### Significance

- Demonstrated European strategic interest
- Showed Palestine could be governed differently
- Accelerated Ottoman reform efforts (Tanzimat)

---

## Tanzimat Era (1839-1876)

### Ottoman Reforms

The Tanzimat ("Reorganization") brought modernization:

| Reform | Date | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| Gülhane Edict | 1839 | Promised equality; rule of law |
| Land Code | 1858 | Modernized land registration |
| Vilayet Law | 1864 | Reorganized provinces |
| Citizenship | 1869 | Ottoman citizenship for all |

### Land Code of 1858

**Critical reform with lasting consequences**:
- Required formal registration of land
- Peasants often registered land under notables' names (to avoid taxes, conscription)
- Created legal basis for later land sales
- Enabled later purchase of land by Jewish organizations

### Jerusalem's Special Status (1872)

- Jerusalem became independent mutasarrifate
- Reported directly to Istanbul (not Damascus)
- Recognition of city's special importance
- Increased European consular presence

## Late Ottoman Period (1876-1914)

### Abdul Hamid II (1876-1909)

| Policy | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Pan-Islamism | Emphasized Sultan's role as Caliph |
| Centralization | Tightened control over provinces |
| Modernization | Telegraph, railways, education |
| Jewish immigration | Initially permitted; later restricted |

### Young Turk Revolution (1908)

- Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) revolution
- Constitutional restoration
- Initial optimism (including Arab liberals)
- Increasing Turkish nationalism alienated Arabs

### Population in 1914

| Group | Estimated Population | Percentage |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Muslims (mostly Arab) | ~500,000-600,000 | ~80% |
| Christians (Arab) | ~70,000-80,000 | ~10% |
| Jews | ~60,000-85,000 | ~8-10% |
| **Total** | ~650,000-750,000 | — |

**Notes**:
- Figures are estimates; no precise census
- Jewish population grew significantly 1880-1914 due to immigration
- About half of Jews were "Old Yishuv" (religious); half "New Yishuv" (Zionist)

## Jewish Communities in Ottoman Palestine

### The "Old Yishuv" (Pre-Zionist)

Continuous Jewish presence, small but significant:

| City | Jewish Community |
|------|-----------------|
| Jerusalem | Largest; Sephardi and Ashkenazi |
| Safed | Kabbalistic center; declined after 1837 earthquake |
| Hebron | Ancient community; small |
| Tiberias | Small; revived by Zahir al-Umar |

**Characteristics**:
- Religious focus (Torah study, prayer at holy sites)
- Dependent on diaspora charity (halukka)
- Not nationalist; oriented toward religious life
- Generally good relations with Ottoman authorities

### Early Zionist Immigration (1882-1914)

**First Aliyah (1882-1903)**:
- ~25,000-35,000 immigrants
- Mostly from Russian Empire (fleeing pogroms)
- Agricultural settlements (moshavot): Rishon LeZion, Petah Tikva, etc.
- Many left; those who stayed laid groundwork

**Second Aliyah (1904-1914)**:
- ~35,000-40,000 immigrants
- More ideologically committed (socialist Zionism)
- Kibbutz movement began
- Ben-Gurion, Ben-Zvi arrived in this period

**Ottoman Response**:
- Initially permitted (especially under Tanzimat liberalization)
- Restrictions increased after 1891 (land purchase limits)
- Abdul Hamid suspicious but enforcement was inconsistent
- Never fully blocked immigration

## Arab Society and Early Nationalism

### Notable Families

Palestinian Arab politics dominated by elite families:
- Husayni family (Jerusalem)
- Nashashibi family (Jerusalem)
- Khalidi family (Jerusalem)
- Shukri and Shuqayri families (Acre)

### Palestinian Arab Identity

**Not yet crystallized as national identity**:
- Local/regional identities strong
- Ottoman citizenship
- Arab cultural identity
- Islamic religious identity
- "Palestinian" as distinct nationalism developed later (20th c.)

### Response to Zionism

Early Arab responses to Zionist immigration:
- 1891: Jerusalem notables petition against immigration
- 1905: Najib Nassar's newspaper criticizes Zionism
- 1908-1914: Increasing Arab press discussion
- Land sales by absentee landlords criticized
- Displacement of fellaheen (peasant farmers) noted

## Key Findings

### 1. Ottoman Palestine Was Not Empty

Contrary to some narratives, Palestine was inhabited and functioning:
- 600,000-750,000 people in 1914
- Agriculture, trade, religious life
- Villages, towns, and the holy cities

### 2. It Was Not a "Country"

Palestine was never a separate Ottoman administrative unit:
- Divided among multiple sanjaks/vilayets
- Borders shifted over time
- No "Palestinian" government or citizenship

### 3. Jewish Communities Existed Throughout

Small but continuous Jewish presence:
- "Old Yishuv" in holy cities
- Generally peaceful coexistence
- Distinct from later Zionist movement

### 4. Zionism Arrived in Late Ottoman Period

First and Second Aliyah (1882-1914):
- Established agricultural presence
- Created tensions with existing population
- Foundation for later conflict

### 5. Arab Nationalism Was Emerging

Not yet specifically Palestinian, but:
- Arab cultural revival
- Critique of Zionist immigration
- Would crystallize in WWI and Mandate period

## Key Quotes

> "In 1891, Jerusalem notables sent a telegram to Istanbul protesting Jewish immigration, one of the first documented Palestinian political acts regarding Zionism."

> "The Land Code of 1858, intended to modernize agriculture, inadvertently created the legal framework that would enable later large-scale land transfers."
