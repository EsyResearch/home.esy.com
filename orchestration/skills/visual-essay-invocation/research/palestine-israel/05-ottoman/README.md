## Module Purpose

This chapter covers four centuries of Ottoman rule (1516-1917), during which:
- Palestine was integrated into a vast multi-ethnic empire
- Administrative structures shaped the land's governance
- Religious communities (millets) maintained distinct identities
- Population demographics shifted through the period
- The late 19th century brought modernization and early nationalism

**Key principle**: Ottoman Palestine was not a separate state, but a region within a larger empire, administered through various provincial structures that changed over time.

## Critical Notes

### On "Ottoman neglect"

A common trope (especially in Zionist historiography): Palestine was "neglected" by the Ottomans, a "backwater" that Jews "revived."

Scholarly view: Palestine was a peripheral province but not uniquely neglected. Population declined in some periods, grew in others. Ottoman governance had both strengths and weaknesses.

### On Pre-Zionist Jewish Communities

Jewish communities existed throughout the Ottoman period:
- "Old Yishuv" — religious communities in Jerusalem, Hebron, Safed, Tiberias
- Largely dependent on diaspora charity (halukka)
- Distinct from later Zionist "New Yishuv"

### On Palestinian Identity

Modern Palestinian national identity crystallized later (see Module 06), but:
- Local/regional identities existed throughout Ottoman period
- "Palestinian" as distinct national identity is largely 20th century phenomenon
- This is not unique — most national identities are modern
