## Overview

This document tracks claims we cannot make definitively, scholarly debates requiring balanced presentation, and politically contested framings around naming.

---

## Tier 1 Gaps: Do Not Claim (Insufficient Evidence)

### Gap 1.1: Precise Etymology of "Canaan"

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | The exact meaning and origin of "Canaan" |
| **Why Insufficient** | Multiple competing theories exist; no scholarly consensus |
| **What We Know** | The name appears in Akkadian (Kinahni), Egyptian, and Hebrew sources; it was used for the Levant region |
| **What We Don't Know** | Whether it derives from Hurrian "purple," Semitic "lowlands," or another source |
| **Competing Theories** | (1) Hurrian for purple (cf. Phoenician); (2) Semitic "to be low/subdued"; (3) Unknown origin |
| **Recommendation** | Present theories as theories: "Scholars have proposed several origins for the name 'Canaan'..." |

### Gap 1.2: Precise Origins of the Peleset/Philistines

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | Exact homeland of the Peleset/Philistines |
| **Why Insufficient** | Archaeological and textual evidence is fragmentary; Sea Peoples origins debated |
| **What We Know** | They arrived ~1200-1150 BCE, likely from Aegean/Mediterranean region; Egyptian records document them |
| **What We Don't Know** | Precisely where they originated (Crete? Mycenae? Cyprus? Anatolia?) |
| **Recommendation** | Use "likely Aegean origin" or "Mediterranean origin"; avoid claiming specific homeland |

### Gap 1.3: Whether Herodotus Meant to Include Jews in "Syrians of Palestine"

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | Herodotus's term Palaistinē specifically referred to/included Jews |
| **Why Insufficient** | Herodotus's ethnographic categories don't map cleanly to later understandings |
| **What We Know** | He used the term for the region between Phoenicia and Egypt; mentioned circumcision |
| **What We Don't Know** | Whether he distinguished Jews from other inhabitants of the region |
| **Recommendation** | Report his geographic usage without claiming ethnic specificity |

## Tier 2 Gaps: Claim with Qualification (Scholarly Debate)

### Gap 2.1: Hadrian's Motivation for Renaming Judaea

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | Why Hadrian renamed the province to Syria Palaestina in 135 CE |
| **Position A** | **Punitive/De-Judaization**: The renaming was specifically intended to erase Jewish connection to the land |
| **Position A Proponents** | Seth Schwartz, Louis Feldman |
| **Position A Sources** | Schwartz: "celebrate the de-Judaization"; Feldman: "obliterate the Jewish character" |
| **Position B** | **Practical/Administrative**: The name change reflected the larger territory and drew on ancient associations |
| **Position B Proponents** | David Jacobson |
| **Position B Sources** | Jacobson suggests practical considerations for larger provincial boundaries |
| **Position C** | **Pre-Revolt Inclination**: The renaming may have reflected Hadrian's existing views on Jews, not just post-revolt punishment |
| **Position C Proponents** | Ronald Syme |
| **Consensus Status** | Actively debated; punitive interpretation is more common but not universal |
| **Esy Approach** | Present scholarly debate: "Historians debate whether the renaming was primarily punitive (Schwartz, Feldman) or practical (Jacobson)..." |

### Gap 2.2: Continuity vs. Discontinuity of "Palestine" Usage

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | Whether "Palestine" was continuously used from antiquity to modernity |
| **Position A** | **Continuity**: The name Palestine has been in continuous use since Herodotus, through all empires |
| **Position A Proponents** | Some Palestinian scholars, Nur Masalha |
| **Position B** | **Discontinuity**: "Palestine" was a geographic term without political meaning until the 20th century |
| **Position B Proponents** | Some Israeli scholars |
| **Scholarly Reality** | The name was used throughout, but its administrative/political status varied greatly by period |
| **Esy Approach** | Document actual usage by period without claiming either pure continuity or discontinuity |

### Gap 2.3: Ottoman Administrative Use of "Palestine"

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | Whether the Ottomans used "Palestine" administratively |
| **Position A** | The Ottomans never used "Palestine" — it was only a European geographic term |
| **Position B** | Documents from the period show the Mutasarrifate was sometimes called "Palestine" |
| **Evidence** | Some Ottoman-era documents and European diplomatic correspondence use "Palestine" for the Jerusalem Mutasarrifate and surrounding sanjaks |
| **Esy Approach** | Note that Ottomans did not have a single administrative unit called "Palestine," but the term appeared in various documents referring to the region |

## Tier 3 Gaps: Politically Contested (Not Historically Contested)

### Gap 3.1: Political Implications of the 135 CE Renaming

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | The significance of Hadrian's renaming for modern claims |
| **Historical Consensus** | Hadrian renamed the province; this is documented in Roman sources |
| **Political Contestation** | Some argue the renaming "proves" Palestine is an artificial construct; others argue it shows continuous naming |
| **Nature of Dispute** | Framing dispute — both sides accept the historical fact but draw opposite political conclusions |
| **Esy Approach** | State the historical fact; note that modern political conclusions cannot be directly derived from ancient administrative decisions |

### Gap 3.2: Who Has the "Older" Claim to the Name

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | Whether Jewish or Palestinian connection to the land is "older" based on naming |
| **Historical Evidence** | Both "Israel/Judah" and "Palestine/Philistia" appear in ancient sources; they referred to different things (peoples vs. geographic regions) |
| **Political Contestation** | Used in modern political arguments by both sides |
| **Esy Approach** | Present naming history without implying that ancient names create modern political rights |

## Narrative Framing Risks

### Risk 1: "Original" Name Framing

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Description** | Presenting any name as the "original" or "true" name of the region |
| **Why Sensitive** | Implies other names are illegitimate; feeds political arguments about rightful ownership |
| **Perspective A** | Some argue "Canaan" is the oldest attested name |
| **Perspective B** | Some argue "Israel" predates "Palestine" as a political entity |
| **Perspective C** | Some argue "Palestine" has deeper continuous usage |
| **Mitigation Strategy** | Use chronological framing ("earliest attested," "subsequently used") without value judgments |
| **Recommended Language** | "The earliest attested name in written records is..." / "The name X appears in sources from..." |
| **Language to Avoid** | "The original name," "The true name," "The legitimate name" |

### Risk 2: "Punitive Renaming" Emphasis

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Description** | Over-emphasizing or under-emphasizing the punitive aspect of Hadrian's renaming |
| **Why Sensitive** | Over-emphasis can imply the name "Palestine" is inherently anti-Jewish; under-emphasis can seem to minimize historical trauma |
| **Mitigation Strategy** | Present scholarly debate honestly; note the renaming is unique in Roman history without drawing modern conclusions |
| **Recommended Language** | "Historians debate whether the renaming was primarily punitive or administrative..." |

### Risk 3: "Continuous" vs. "Constructed" Identity

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Description** | Implying Palestinian identity is either "ancient" or "invented in the 20th century" |
| **Why Sensitive** | Both framings are politically loaded and historically oversimplified |
| **Mitigation Strategy** | Focus on naming facts; note that national identities are modern constructs everywhere |
| **Recommended Language** | "The name 'Palestine' has been used for the region since antiquity, though its administrative status varied by period..." |

## Terminology Guidance

| Term | Issue | Recommended Usage | Avoid |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Palestine | Contested as political term | Use historically for periods when documented; note administrative status | Implying it was always a state or never existed |
| Israel | Modern state vs. ancient kingdom | Distinguish "ancient Israel/Judah" from "State of Israel (1948)" | Conflating ancient and modern |
| Holy Land | Religious framing | Note it's a religious designation, not administrative | Using as neutral geographic term |
| Judea/Samaria | Modern Israeli term for West Bank | Note it's the Israeli official term; also note historical usage | Using without context as if neutral |
| West Bank | Jordanian-origin term | Note it's the international standard term | Claiming it's the only legitimate term |

## Impact on Spec Construction

| Gap | Spec Element Affected | Handling |
|-----|----------------------|----------|
| Gap 1.1 (Canaan etymology) | Sidebar text | Present theories, no definitive claim |
| Gap 2.1 (Hadrian motivation) | Roman/Byzantine chapter | Present scholarly debate |
| Gap 3.1 (Political implications) | All chapters | Avoid drawing modern political conclusions from ancient naming |
| Risk 1 (Original name) | Sidebar structure | Chronological organization, no "original" framing |
| Risk 2 (Punitive emphasis) | Roman chapter | Balance scholarly views |
