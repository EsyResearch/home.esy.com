# Research Synthesis: Naming & Etymology Sidebar

## Executive Summary

The name "Palestine" derives from "Peleset," an Egyptian term for Sea Peoples who settled the southern coast ~1150 BCE. Greek historian Herodotus (5th c. BCE) first applied "Palaistinē" to the broader region between Phoenicia and Egypt. The Romans administratively adopted the name "Syria Palaestina" in 135 CE after the Bar Kokhba revolt. The name has been used continuously since — through Byzantine, Islamic, Crusader, Ottoman, and British periods — though its administrative status has varied dramatically.

The region has been called by many names: Canaan (Bronze Age), Philistia (coastal Iron Age), Judaea (Roman province), Syria Palaestina (post-135 CE), Jund Filastin (Islamic), various Ottoman sanjaks, and Mandatory Palestine (British). Understanding this naming history answers why the region "isn't always called Palestine" — different empires and peoples used different names for overlapping but not identical territories.

## Core Thesis

**Names are lenses, not proofs.** The history of what this region has been called reveals how different peoples and empires saw it — as a geographic entity, an administrative unit, a sacred space, or a political claim. No single name has exclusive historical legitimacy; the land has always been multi-named, reflecting its multi-peopled reality.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: The Etymology is Traceable

The name "Palestine" has a clear etymological chain:

```
Peleset (Egyptian, ~1150 BCE)
  → Peleshet (Hebrew) / Palashtu (Assyrian)
    → Palaistinē (Greek, Herodotus ~450 BCE)
      → Palaestina (Latin, Roman administration)
        → Filastin (Arabic, Islamic period)
          → Palestine (English, via Latin/Greek)
```

This etymology connects to the Philistines, a people of likely Aegean origin who settled the southern coast. The name originally referred to their coastal territory, then was extended by Greek and Roman writers to the broader region.

### Finding 2: "Palestine" Predates Roman Administrative Use

A common misconception holds that "Palestine" was a Roman invention of 135 CE. In fact:
- Herodotus used "Palaistinē" in the 5th century BCE — 600 years before Hadrian
- Aristotle, Polemon, and other Greek writers used similar terms
- The Romans adopted an existing geographic name, they didn't invent it

However, the 135 CE renaming **is significant**: it was the first use of "Palaestina" as an official Roman provincial name, and it replaced "Judaea" (a name with explicit Jewish association). This renaming is unique in Roman history — the only province renamed specifically after a revolt.

### Finding 3: Administrative Names ≠ Geographic Names

A key distinction must be maintained:
- **Geographic names**: How writers and peoples referred to the region informally
- **Administrative names**: Official empire/state designations

For most of history, "Palestine" was primarily a geographic term. Administrative names varied:
- Judaea (Roman province, pre-135)
- Syria Palaestina (Roman/Byzantine, post-135)
- Jund Filastin (Islamic military district)
- Sanjak of Jerusalem, etc. (Ottoman)
- Palestine (British Mandate, 1920-1948) — first modern administrative use

### Finding 4: The Islamic Period Maintained Continuity

When Arab armies conquered the region (636-640 CE), they established "Jund Filastin" as a military district — using the Arabic form of "Palestine." This shows:
- The name was in continuous use through the Byzantine-Islamic transition
- Muslims largely maintained existing administrative geography
- "Filastin" remained the standard Arabic name for the region

### Finding 5: Ottoman Administration Did Not Use "Palestine" Officially

The Ottomans (1517-1917) did not have a single administrative unit called "Palestine." Instead, the region was divided among multiple sanjaks (Jerusalem, Nablus, Acre) and larger vilayets. However:
- European sources continued using "Palestine" geographically
- Some Ottoman-era documents also used the term informally
- The three sanjaks together roughly corresponded to what Europeans called "Palestine"

### Finding 6: Modern Administrative "Palestine" Began in 1920

The British Mandate (1920-1948) was the first modern administrative entity officially called "Palestine" with defined borders. This created the territorial basis for both Israeli and Palestinian national claims.

## Narrative Arc for Sidebar

### Structure Recommendation

The sidebar should follow a chronological structure with clear demarcation between geographic and administrative naming:

1. **Opening**: Names as lenses — the land has always been multi-named
2. **Etymology**: Trace Peleset → Palestine etymology
3. **Ancient Usage**: Herodotus and Greek writers (5th-4th c. BCE)
4. **Roman Transition**: 135 CE renaming — context, debate, significance
5. **Islamic Continuity**: Jund Filastin (7th-11th c.)
6. **Ottoman Ambiguity**: No "Palestine" province, but name persisted
7. **Mandate Consolidation**: 1920-1948 — modern administrative Palestine
8. **Today**: Competing names (Israel, Palestine, West Bank, etc.)
9. **Closing**: Names reflect claims, not determine them

### Emotional Arc

- **Opening**: Curiosity — "What's in a name?"
- **Middle**: Recognition — names change with power, but people remain
- **Closing**: Nuance — no single "true" name; understanding naming history helps, but doesn't resolve, the conflict
