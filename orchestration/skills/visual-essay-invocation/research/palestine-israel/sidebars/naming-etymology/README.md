## Module Purpose

This sidebar answers two key questions from the essay prompt:

1. **What has the region been called across time?**
   - Timeline of names (administrative, geographic, political)
   - Who used each name and why
   - How usage changed by empire, language, governance

2. **Why isn't it always called "Palestine"?**
   - Etymology: Peleset → Philistines → Palaistinē → Palaestina → Filastin → Palestine
   - Administrative renaming by empires
   - Political implications of naming

---

## Research Questions

5. How do different communities use different names today, and why?

### Secondary Questions
1. What was the region called before "Peleset" appears in records?
2. How did "Canaan" relate to later naming?
3. What were the Roman/Byzantine administrative divisions?
4. How did "Filastin" function under Islamic rule?
5. What did the Ottomans call the region administratively?
6. How did British Mandate naming differ from Ottoman?

## Notes

- This module is foundational — its findings feed into multiple chapters
- Etymology claims must be carefully sourced (linguistics is specialized)
- Political sensitivities around naming require multi-tradition sourcing
- Distinguish between: geographic names, administrative names, political names, self-identification
