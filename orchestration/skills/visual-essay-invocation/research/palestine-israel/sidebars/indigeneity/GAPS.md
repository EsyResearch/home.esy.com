# Research Gaps: "Indigeneity" Without Propaganda

> **Module**: sidebars/indigeneity

## Tier 1: Do Not Claim

1. **"X is the only indigenous people"** — Neither claim supportable; definition contested
2. **Genetic claims to land rights** — DNA doesn't confer political rights; science misused politically
3. **Continuous Jewish majority presence** — Small communities existed, but Arabs were majority for 1,300+ years
4. **Palestinians as "just Arabs from Arabia"** — Ignores Arabization of existing populations
5. **Modern Israelis as "just Europeans"** — Ignores Mizrahi Jews, Jewish persecution

---

## Tier 2: Scholarly Debate

### Definition of Indigeneity
1. **Does "indigenous" apply to this conflict at all?**
   - Position A: Yes — both peoples have deep roots; framework useful
   - Position B: No — framework designed for post-1500 colonialism; anachronistic here
   - Position C: Partial — some aspects apply, others don't
   - Esy Approach: Present framework origins; note limited applicability; focus on specific historical evidence

### Jewish Connection
2. **Nature of Jewish connection to the land**
   - Position A: Indigenous return (continuous connection, never fully severed)
   - Position B: Settler colonialism (modern return is colonial, regardless of ancient origins)
   - Position C: Unique case (neither model fits perfectly)
   - Esy Approach: Present historical evidence; note modern Zionism's complex motivations; avoid either extreme

### Palestinian Connection
3. **Nature of Palestinian Arab connection**
   - Position A: Indigenous presence (continuous since 7th century, many descended from pre-Arab populations)
   - Position B: Later arrivals (came with Arab conquest; not "original" inhabitants)
   - Esy Approach: Note 1,300+ years of presence; note Arabization process; avoid "just invaders" framing

### Settler Colonialism Framework
4. **Is Zionism settler colonialism?**
   - Position A: Yes — fits definition (metropole, settlers, displacement of natives)
   - Position B: No — unique case (refugees, ancient connection, no imperial metropole)
   - Position C: Partial fit — some characteristics but not all
   - Esy Approach: Present scholarly debate; note framework has explanatory power and limits

---

## Tier 3: Politically Contested (Not Historically)

### Genetic Studies
1. **Genetic connections**
   - Evidence: Studies show genetic links between Jews (including Ashkenazi) and Levantine populations
   - Evidence: Studies show Palestinian genetic continuity with ancient Levantine populations
   - Political use: Both sides cite genetics to claim "more indigenous"
   - Esy Approach: Genetics don't determine political rights; note studies exist; don't use as political argument

### "Right of Return"
2. **Who has "right" to the land?**
   - Israeli position: Jewish historical connection + persecution justifies return
   - Palestinian position: Displacement in living memory; UN Resolution 194
   - Esy Approach: Both claims exist; present historical basis; don't adjudicate

### Terminology
3. **What to call the peoples**
   - "Indigenous" — contested
   - "Native" — contested
   - "Original inhabitants" — contested (which era?)
   - Esy Approach: Use historical descriptions; note terminology is politically charged

## Narrative Framing Risks

### Risk 1: False equivalence
- **Risk**: "Both sides have claims" can obscure power asymmetry
- **Mitigation**: Present historical evidence; note current realities (sovereignty, statelessness, occupation)

### Risk 2: Taking sides via definition
- **Risk**: Choosing one definition of "indigenous" advantages one side
- **Mitigation**: Present multiple definitions; note all are contested; focus on specific evidence

### Risk 3: Genetic determinism
- **Risk**: Genetics cited as proof of land rights
- **Mitigation**: Note genetics don't confer political rights; present as interesting but not determinative

### Risk 4: Erasing complexity
- **Risk**: Simplifying 3,000+ years into a slogan
- **Mitigation**: Present full timeline; acknowledge multiple migrations, conversions, changes

## Terminology Guidance

| Term | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Indigenous | Use with caution; note contested; prefer specific historical descriptions |
| Native | Same caution |
| Original inhabitants | Specify time period |
| Settler colonialism | Present as scholarly framework; note debate about applicability |
| Return | Jewish "return" is ideological claim; Palestinian "return" refers to 1948 refugees |
| Diaspora | Both peoples have diasporas; use for both |
| Ancient | Specify time period; avoid vague "ancient claim" |

---

## Key Principle

**Indigeneity claims are political arguments dressed as history.**

Both peoples have deep historical connections:
- Jews: Ancient origin, diaspora maintenance, modern return
- Palestinian Arabs: 1,300+ years of continuous presence, displacement in living memory

Neither claim negates the other. Focus on:
- What the evidence shows
- What frameworks scholars use
- Why simple answers fail
- What questions matter more (justice, rights, peace)

## What This Sidebar Should NOT Do

1. ❌ Declare one side "indigenous" and one side "colonizers"
2. ❌ Use genetics to adjudicate political claims
3. ❌ Pretend there's a neutral answer to "who was here first"
4. ❌ Ignore power asymmetry while presenting "both sides"
5. ❌ Avoid the question entirely — it's too important to readers

## What This Sidebar SHOULD Do

1. ✅ Explain what "indigenous" means (and doesn't mean)
2. ✅ Present historical evidence for both peoples' connections
3. ✅ Show why simple framings fail
4. ✅ Redirect to better questions (justice, rights, peace)
5. ✅ Trust readers to handle complexity
