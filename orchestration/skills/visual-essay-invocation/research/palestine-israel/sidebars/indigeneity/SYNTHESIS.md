# Research Synthesis: "Indigeneity" Without Propaganda

## Executive Summary

The question "Who is indigenous to Palestine/Israel?" is asked constantly in debates about the conflict. Yet the question itself is problematic. "Indigeneity" as a legal and anthropological concept was developed for specific historical situations — primarily European colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Africa — that don't map cleanly onto the Israel/Palestine case. Both Jews and Palestinian Arabs have deep historical connections to the land. Using "indigenous" as a political trump card obscures rather than illuminates history.

## Core Thesis

**The "indigenous" framing fails this conflict.**

Both peoples have legitimate historical claims of different types:
- Jews: Ancient origin, continuous religious/textual connection, interrupted presence, modern return
- Palestinian Arabs: 1,300+ years of continuous majority presence, displacement in living memory

Neither claim negates the other. Understanding both is essential.

## What "Indigenous" Means

### UN Framework (UNDRIP)

The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007) doesn't provide a universal definition, but working definitions include populations that:

1. Are descended from pre-colonial inhabitants
2. Maintain distinct cultural, social, economic, political systems
3. Self-identify as indigenous
4. Have experienced colonization, marginalization, dispossession

**Key context**: UNDRIP emerged from advocacy by First Nations (Americas), Aboriginal Australians, Māori, Sámi, and similar groups displaced by European expansion post-1500.

### Anthropological Framework

Anthropologists use "indigenous" to describe:
- First peoples of a region
- Populations with deep ancestral ties
- Groups maintaining traditional practices connected to land

**Key issue**: When does "deep" become "indigenous"? 500 years? 1,000? 3,000? No universal standard exists.

### Political Use

In the Israel/Palestine conflict, "indigenous" is deployed as:
- A moral claim ("We were here first")
- A political argument ("You are colonizers")
- An identity marker (authentic belonging vs. foreign intrusion)

Both Israeli and Palestinian advocates claim indigeneity. Both reject the other's claim.

## Historical Evidence

### Jewish Historical Connection

**Archaeological Evidence**:
- Iron Age Israelite kingdoms (c. 1000-586 BCE)
- Jerusalem as Israelite/Jewish capital
- Temple, synagogues, inscriptions throughout the land
- Continuously referenced in ancient sources (Jewish, Greek, Roman)

**Textual/Religious Connection**:
- Hebrew Bible centered on the land
- Daily prayers mention Jerusalem, Zion
- Religious law includes land-based commandments
- Passover: "Next year in Jerusalem" — maintained for 2,000 years

**Continuous Presence**:
- Jewish communities persisted throughout history (small numbers)
- Four "holy cities": Jerusalem, Hebron, Safed, Tiberias
- Never entirely absent, though often marginal
- Major return began late 19th century

**Diaspora Experience**:
- Exile resulted from Roman conquest, not voluntary departure
- 2,000 years of dispersion, persecution, maintained distinct identity
- Holocaust (1933-1945) killed 6 million — context for state creation

### Palestinian Arab Historical Connection

**Conquest and Settlement**:
- Arab conquest 636-640 CE
- Gradual Arabization of existing populations
- Arabic language, Islamic (and Christian) culture became dominant

**Continuous Majority Presence**:
- From 7th century to 1948: Arab majority in the land
- Ottoman census (late 19th c.): Arabs 85-90% of population
- Farmers, merchants, craftsmen, religious figures
- Villages, towns, agriculture continuously developed

**Cultural Development**:
- Palestinian identity crystallized in late 19th-early 20th century
- Distinct dialect, customs, cuisine, embroidery traditions
- Jerusalem as cultural and religious center
- Continuous land cultivation, property ownership

**Displacement (Nakba)**:
- 1948: 700,000+ Palestinians fled or expelled
- Villages destroyed; property confiscated
- Continuous presence interrupted for first time in 1,300+ years
- Refugees and descendants: 5-6 million today

## Why Simple Framings Fail

### Framing 1: "Jews are the indigenous people; Arabs are invaders"

**Proponents**: Some Israeli advocates, Christian Zionists
**Argument**: Jews are the original inhabitants; Arabs came from Arabia in the 7th century

**Problems**:
1. **Ignores 1,300 years**: Arabs have lived there longer than most "indigenous" peoples elsewhere
2. **Conflates ancient and modern**: Modern Israelis include many whose families lived elsewhere for 2,000 years
3. **Ignores Arabization**: Many "Arabs" descended from pre-Arab populations who adopted Arabic language/culture
4. **Ignores Mizrahi Jews**: Many Israeli Jews came from Arab/Middle Eastern countries — not "European colonizers"

### Framing 2: "Palestinians are indigenous; Zionists are European colonizers"

**Proponents**: Some Palestinian advocates, anti-Zionist activists
**Argument**: Palestinians lived there continuously; Zionists are settler colonials like South Africa or Algeria

**Problems**:
1. **Ignores Jewish historical connection**: 3,000+ years of connection is not nothing
2. **Ignores Mizrahi Jews**: ~50% of Israeli Jews came from Middle East/North Africa
3. **Oversimplifies Zionism**: Jewish return was partly refugee movement (especially Holocaust survivors)
4. **Erases Jewish persecution**: Jews weren't "privileged colonizers" but persecuted minorities fleeing death

### Framing 3: "Both are indigenous" (selective version)

**Proponents**: Some advocates for coexistence
**Argument**: Both have claims; let's share

**Problem**: Often used to avoid addressing power asymmetries, occupation, ongoing displacement

### Better Framing: Historical Complexity

Both peoples have deep connections — of different types:

| People | Type of Connection | Duration | Current Status |
|--------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| Jews | Ancient origin + diaspora maintenance + return | 3,000+ years (interrupted) | Sovereignty since 1948 |
| Palestinian Arabs | Continuous presence + majority status | 1,300+ years (interrupted 1948) | Statelessness, occupation, diaspora |

Neither claim is "more valid" in absolute terms. History doesn't assign moral winners.

## What Scholars Say

### Anthropologists

Most anthropologists **avoid applying "indigenous" to this conflict** because:
- The framework was developed for different historical situations
- Both populations have deep ties
- The term is too politically charged to be analytically useful

### Historians

Historians generally acknowledge:
- Jewish ancient connection and diaspora experience
- Arab continuous presence and displacement
- Nationalism as the framework for both movements
- Neither population is simply "foreign"

### Legal Scholars

International law scholars note:
- UNDRIP wasn't designed for this situation
- Both peoples have self-determination claims
- The conflict is better framed through: occupation law, refugee law, self-determination

## Key Takeaways

1. **"Indigenous" is a contested concept** — no universal definition applies
2. **Both peoples have historical connections** — of different types and durations
3. **Simple framings serve politics, not history** — "indigenous" claims are deployed polemically
4. **Better questions exist**:
   - What happened in 1948 and why?
   - What are the rights of refugees?
   - What does justice require now?
   - How can both peoples achieve self-determination?
