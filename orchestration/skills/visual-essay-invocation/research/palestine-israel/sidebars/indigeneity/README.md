## Module Purpose

This sidebar addresses the contested question of "who is indigenous" to the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Rather than adjudicating competing claims, it:

1. Defines what "indigeneity" means in different contexts (UN, anthropological, political)
2. Examines the evidence for different populations' historical presence
3. Explains why simple "indigenous/non-indigenous" framing fails this case
4. Presents what scholars and legal frameworks actually say

**Key insight**: Both peoples have deep historical connections to the land. The question of "who is indigenous" often serves political arguments rather than historical understanding.

---

## Core Questions

1. What does "indigenous" mean in international law?
2. What does "indigenous" mean anthropologically?
3. What is the historical evidence for Jewish connection to the land?
4. What is the historical evidence for Palestinian Arab connection to the land?
5. Why do simple framings fail?
6. What do scholars actually say?

## Key Findings

### Definition Matters

**UN Definition** (UNDRIP context):
- Descended from populations inhabiting region before colonization
- Maintain distinct cultural/social/economic systems
- Self-identify as indigenous
- Designed for cases like Americas, Australia — settler colonialism of recent centuries

**Problem for Israel/Palestine**:
- Multiple waves of settlement over millennia
- No clear "pre-colonial" baseline
- Both populations have been present for centuries+
- Both have experienced displacement
- UN definition doesn't map cleanly

### Historical Presence Evidence

**Jewish Connection**:
- Archaeological evidence of Israelite kingdoms (Iron Age)
- Continuous textual/religious connection over 2,000+ years
- Some continuous presence (small communities, especially in Jerusalem, Safed, Hebron, Tiberias)
- Modern return (19th-20th century immigration)
- Self-determination realized in 1948

**Palestinian Arab Connection**:
- Arab presence since 7th century conquest
- Continuous presence and majority population for ~1,300 years
- Ottoman census shows overwhelming Arab majority pre-Zionism
- Villages, agriculture, culture continuously developed
- Displacement in 1948 (Nakba) disrupted continuous presence

### Why Simple Framings Fail

| Claim | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| "Jews are the only indigenous people" | Ignores 1,300 years of Arab presence; conflates ancient and modern |
| "Palestinians are the only indigenous people" | Ignores Jewish historical connection; privileges recent continuous presence |
| "Jews are just European colonizers" | Ignores Mizrahi Jews; ignores ancient connection; ignores persecution driving emigration |
| "Palestinians are just Arab invaders" | Ignores continuity of pre-Arab populations who Arabized; ignores centuries of rootedness |

### Scholarly Consensus

Most scholars avoid "indigenous" framing for this conflict because:

1. It's anachronistic — designed for post-1500 colonial contexts
2. Both peoples have legitimate historical claims
3. The conflict is better understood through nationalism, state-building, displacement
4. "Indigenous" language is used polemically by both sides
