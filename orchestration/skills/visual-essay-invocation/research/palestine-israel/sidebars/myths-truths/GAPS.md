# Research Gaps: Common Myths / Common Truths

> **Module**: sidebars/myths-truths
> **Last Updated**: December 23, 2024

## Tier 1: Do Not Claim

1. **Exact percentages of opinion** — "Most Israelis believe X" without polling data
2. **Intent attributions** — "They know they're lying" about any group
3. **Moral equivalence** — "Both sides are equally wrong" (evidence varies by issue)
4. **Resolution predictions** — "This will lead to peace/war"

---

## Tier 2: Scholarly Debate

### Definition of "Myth"
1. **What counts as a myth?**
   - Position A: Factually false claims
   - Position B: Oversimplified claims (contain truth but mislead)
   - Position C: Politically motivated framing (not false, but selective)
   - Esy Approach: Include all three; distinguish between false vs. oversimplified

### Comparative Evil
2. **Is Israel's human rights record uniquely bad?**
   - Position A: Yes — duration, scale, international impunity
   - Position B: No — comparable or worse situations exist
   - Position C: Wrong question — each situation deserves scrutiny
   - Esy Approach: Acknowledge Israeli violations; note comparative context; don't adjudicate

### Peace Process Failures
3. **Who killed the peace process?**
   - Position A: Palestinian rejectionism
   - Position B: Israeli settlement expansion
   - Position C: Both, plus international failures
   - Esy Approach: Present evidence of failures on both sides; avoid assigning sole blame

## Tier 3: Politically Contested

1. **"Pro-Israel" vs "Pro-Palestinian"**
   - These categories themselves are contested
   - Some claim to be pro-both; some reject both labels
   - Esy Approach: Use labels descriptively; acknowledge people don't fit neatly

2. **What counts as "violence"?**
   - Physical attacks (clear)
   - Structural violence (contested — occupation, blockade)
   - Rhetoric (contested — dehumanization)
   - Esy Approach: Focus on documented physical violence; note structural violence debates

3. **Antisemitism vs. criticism of Israel**
   - Some criticism of Israel is antisemitic
   - Some criticism of Israel is legitimate
   - Line is genuinely contested
   - Esy Approach: Don't adjudicate; note debate exists; focus on specific claims

## Narrative Framing Risks

### Risk 1: False balance
- **Risk**: "Both sides have myths" implies equal culpability
- **Mitigation**: Present each myth on its own terms; let evidence speak; don't force symmetry

### Risk 2: Seeming to validate one side
- **Risk**: Debunking more myths from one side seems partisan
- **Mitigation**: Select comparable myths; acknowledge selection is imperfect

### Risk 3: "Both sides" nihilism
- **Risk**: "Everyone lies" conclusion
- **Mitigation**: End with truths, not just myths; show complexity isn't confusion

### Risk 4: Reader polarization
- **Risk**: Readers only see myths from "their side" as attacked
- **Mitigation**: Frame as truth-seeking, not side-taking; model intellectual honesty

## Terminology Guidance

| Term | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Myth | Use for demonstrably false or seriously misleading claims |
| Oversimplification | Use for claims with some truth but that mislead |
| Propaganda | Avoid — too charged; use "political advocacy" or "messaging" |
| Truth | Reserve for well-documented facts, not opinions |
| Both sides | Use sparingly; acknowledge asymmetries |
| Debunked | Only for claims with strong contrary evidence |

## Key Principle

**This sidebar is not about scoring points.**

Goals:
- Model intellectual honesty
- Show that truth-seeking transcends "sides"
- Give readers tools to evaluate claims
- Acknowledge uncomfortable facts from one's own "side"

This sidebar fails if:
- It becomes a gotcha list against either side
- It implies moral equivalence where evidence differs
- It leaves readers cynical rather than informed
- It doesn't acknowledge real grievances underlying myths
