## Module Purpose

This sidebar addresses widespread misconceptions held by advocates on both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict. Rather than scoring points, it aims to:

1. Identify claims repeated as fact that are oversimplified or false
2. Present what the historical record actually shows
3. Acknowledge uncomfortable truths that each "side" tends to minimize
4. Model how to hold complexity without collapsing into relativism

**Key insight**: Both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian advocacy contain myths that serve political arguments but obscure history. Truth-telling requires honesty about one's own "side."
