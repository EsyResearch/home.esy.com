## Module Purpose

This chapter covers the Islamic and medieval periods (~638-1516 CE), during which:
- The Arab conquest brought the region under Islamic rule
- The name "Filastin" (فلسطين) was used in Arabic administration
- Jerusalem became the third holiest city in Islam
- The Crusades brought European Christian control (1099-1291)
- Ayyubid and Mamluk dynasties restored Islamic rule

**Key principle**: The region was predominantly Muslim-ruled for nearly 1,300 years (638-1917, with Crusader interruption), with continuous Jewish and Christian minorities.

## Critical Notes

### On "Arab Colonization"

The Arab conquest is sometimes framed as:
- **One view**: "Arab colonization" — foreign conquest comparable to later European colonialism
- **Other view**: "Islamization" — religious and cultural transformation, not ethnic replacement

Scholarly consensus: The Arab conquest brought new rulers and religion, but most of the population remained and converted gradually. This was empire, not settler colonialism in the modern sense.

### On Crusades

The Crusades are viewed very differently:
- **Western tradition**: Religious war, sometimes romanticized
- **Arab/Muslim tradition**: "Frankish invasions" — European colonial violence
- **Israeli tradition**: Sometimes compared to Jewish return

Scholarly approach: Present the Crusades as a period of European conquest with significant violence; note religious and political motivations; avoid romanticization or direct modern analogies.
