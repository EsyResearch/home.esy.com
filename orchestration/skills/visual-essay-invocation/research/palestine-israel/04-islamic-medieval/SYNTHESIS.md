## Executive Summary

The Islamic and medieval period (~638-1516 CE) saw nearly 900 years of predominantly Muslim rule, interrupted by the Crusader interlude (1099-1291). The Arab conquest brought Islam, the Arabic language, and new administrative structures. The population largely remained but gradually converted and Arabized. Jews and Christians continued as dhimmi (protected) communities. The Crusades brought violence and displacement, but also contact between civilizations. Under Ayyubid and Mamluk rule, the region was integrated into larger Middle Eastern empires, with Jerusalem maintaining religious significance for all three Abrahamic faiths.

**Critical finding**: The Arab conquest was not "replacement" — the population largely remained. Arabization and Islamization were gradual processes over centuries.

## Core Thesis

**Continuity through transformation.** The same land, with the same agriculture, the same villages, the same trade routes — but new rulers, new religion (for most), new language. The population of Byzantine Palestine became the population of Islamic Palestine. They adopted Arabic, mostly converted to Islam (over generations), but were not replaced. Modern Palestinians descend largely from this transformed population, not from Arabian immigrants.

## The Arab Conquest (636-640 CE)

### Military Campaign

| Event | Date | Significance |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Battle of Yarmouk | 636 CE | Decisive defeat of Byzantines; Syria falls |
| Jerusalem surrenders | 638 CE | Patriarch Sophronius surrenders to Caliph Umar |
| Caesarea falls | 640 CE | Last Byzantine holdout conquered |

### Caliph Umar's Entry

Umar ibn al-Khattab entered Jerusalem and:
- Reportedly refused to pray in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (to prevent future Muslim claims)
- Ordered the Temple Mount cleared (it had been used as garbage dump)
- Established initial Muslim prayer site (later Al-Aqsa location)
- Granted security to Christians and their churches

### The Covenant of Umar

Traditional dhimmi covenant (authenticity debated):
- Christians and Jews as "protected peoples" (dhimmi)
- Pay jizya (poll tax) and kharaj (land tax)
- Restrictions on new church/synagogue construction
- Cannot bear arms or ride horses
- In exchange: Life, property, and worship protected

**Scholarly note**: The text as we have it may be later elaboration; basic dhimmi principles were established early.

## Umayyad Period (661-750 CE)

### Damascus-Centered Caliphate

- Capital moved from Medina to Damascus
- Palestine remained close to center of power
- Major building projects in Jerusalem

### The Dome of the Rock (691 CE)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Builder | Caliph Abd al-Malik |
| Location | Temple Mount / Haram al-Sharif |
| Purpose | Shrine over the Foundation Stone (debated purposes) |
| Significance | Oldest extant Islamic monument; architectural masterpiece |
| Inscriptions | Earliest Quranic inscriptions; polemics against Christianity |

### Al-Aqsa Mosque

- Built/expanded under Umayyads
- "The Farthest Mosque" (Quran 17:1)
- Associated with Prophet Muhammad's Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj)
- Third holiest site in Islam

### Jund Filastin

Administrative district (jund):
- Capital: Initially Lydda (Ludd), later Ramla (new city founded ~715 CE)
- Covered roughly southern Palestine
- Northern part was Jund al-Urdunn (Jordan district)

### Arabization

Gradual process:
- Arabic became administrative language (replacing Greek)
- Local Aramaic dialects persisted for centuries
- Arab settlers arrived but were minority
- Local population adopted Arabic over generations

---

## Abbasid Period (750-969 CE)

### Shift of Power

- Abbasid revolution (750 CE) — capital moves to Baghdad
- Palestine becomes peripheral province
- Less imperial investment; continued gradual Islamization

### Ongoing Conversion

- By 9th-10th century, likely majority Muslim
- Christians remained significant minority
- Jewish communities smaller but present
- Conversion driven by tax advantages, social integration, genuine belief

### Economy and Society

- Agriculture continued (olives, grapes, wheat)
- Trade routes through region
- Pilgrimage (Jewish, Christian, and now Muslim) continued
- Jerusalem maintained religious importance

---

## Fatimid Period (969-1073 CE)

### Shi'a Rule from Egypt

- Fatimid Caliphate conquered Palestine
- Shi'a Muslim rule (vs. Sunni Abbasids)
- Generally tolerant period initially

### Al-Hakim's Persecutions (996-1021 CE)

Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah:
- Ordered destruction of Church of Holy Sepulchre (1009 CE)
- Persecuted Christians, Jews, and even Sunni Muslims
- Erratic policies; later reversed by successors
- Holy Sepulchre eventually rebuilt (1048)

**Significance**: Hakim's destruction was cited as casus belli for First Crusade (though exaggerated in Crusader propaganda).

---

## The Crusades (1099-1291 CE)

### First Crusade

| Event | Date | Details |
|-------|------|---------|
| Pope Urban II's call | 1095 CE | Council of Clermont |
| Siege of Jerusalem | June-July 1099 | Crusaders capture city |
| Massacre | July 15, 1099 | Jews and Muslims slaughtered |

**The massacre**: Contemporary sources (both Christian and Muslim) describe widespread killing:
- Muslims killed in Al-Aqsa Mosque
- Jews burned in synagogue
- Estimates range from thousands to tens of thousands

### Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem (1099-1187)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Rulers | European Christian aristocracy |
| Population | Minority Frankish rulers over majority local population |
| Religion | Catholic Christian; Eastern churches tolerated |
| Jews | Initially expelled from Jerusalem; later returned |
| Muslims | Peasant population largely remained |

### Crusader Society

- "Franks" ruled; local Christians (often called "Syrians") lower status
- Muslims and Jews as second-class subjects
- Trade and commerce continued
- Castles, churches, fortifications built

### Saladin's Reconquest (1187)

| Event | Date | Significance |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Battle of Hattin | July 4, 1187 | Decisive Crusader defeat |
| Fall of Jerusalem | October 2, 1187 | Saladin captures city |
| Treatment | Ransomed population; churches preserved |

**Contrast with 1099**: Saladin's capture was notably less violent than the Crusaders' — ransomed rather than massacred.

### Third Crusade (1189-1192)

- Richard I of England, Philip II of France, Frederick I of Germany
- Acre recaptured (1191); Richard defeated Saladin at Arsuf
- Treaty: Jerusalem remains Muslim; Christian pilgrimage permitted
- Crusader coastal strip survives

### Final Crusader Expulsion

| Event | Date | Details |
|-------|------|---------|
| Mamluk offensive | 1263-1291 | Sultan Baybars and successors |
| Fall of Acre | 1291 | Last major Crusader city |
| End of Latin Kingdom | 1291 | Crusader presence eliminated |

---

## Ayyubid Period (1187-1250 CE)

### Saladin's Dynasty

- Kurdish Sunni dynasty founded by Saladin
- Controlled Egypt and Syria (including Palestine)
- Jerusalem returned to Muslim control
- Jews invited back to Jerusalem

### Frederick II's Crusade (1228-1229)

Unusual diplomatic Crusade:
- Frederick II (Holy Roman Emperor) negotiated with al-Kamil
- Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth returned to Crusaders (1229)
- No military conquest; diplomatic treaty
- Jerusalem returned to Muslims (1244)

---

## Mamluk Period (1250-1516 CE)

### Slave-Soldier Dynasty

Mamluks: Military slaves (mostly Turkic, later Circassian) who became rulers
- Overthrew Ayyubids in Egypt
- Defeated Mongols at Ain Jalut (1260)
- Expelled final Crusaders
- Ruled until Ottoman conquest (1516-1517)

### Palestine Under Mamluks

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Status | Province of Egyptian-based empire |
| Economy | Agricultural; pilgrimage; some trade |
| Population | Predominantly Muslim; Christian and Jewish minorities |
| Jerusalem | Religiously important; not politically central |

### Jewish Communities

- Small but continuous presence
- Safed and Hebron as Jewish centers
- Pilgrimage and messianic expectations
- 1267: Nahmanides (Ramban) arrived in Jerusalem, found tiny Jewish community

### End of Period

- Ottoman conquest (1516-1517)
- Battle of Marj Dabiq (1516) — Mamluks defeated
- Palestine incorporated into Ottoman Empire

## Population and Demography

### Gradual Transformation

| Century | Estimated Religious Composition |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| 7th CE | Majority Christian; Jewish, Samaritan minorities |
| 10th CE | Majority Muslim; significant Christian minority; small Jewish |
| 13th CE | Large Muslim majority; Christian minority; small Jewish |
| 15th CE | Predominantly Muslim; small Christian and Jewish communities |

**Note**: These are rough estimates; precise figures unavailable.

### Continuity vs. Replacement

**Key scholarly point**: The population was not replaced by Arab immigrants.

- Arab soldiers and administrators arrived, but were minority
- Local population (former Byzantine subjects) converted over centuries
- Some Arab tribal settlement, but not demographic replacement
- Modern Palestinians' ancestors are largely the same population as Byzantine Palestine — transformed by Arabization and Islamization

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Arabization Was Gradual

Arabic became the dominant language over several centuries. This was cultural transformation, not population replacement.

### 2. Conversion Was Gradual

Islamization occurred over generations. Christians remained significant minority for centuries. Jews remained throughout.

### 3. The Crusades Were Violent Colonial Interlude

European Christian conquest brought violence (1099 massacre) and nearly 200 years of rule, but did not permanently alter the population.

### 4. Jerusalem's Triple Holiness

By the medieval period, Jerusalem was sacred to all three Abrahamic faiths, creating the layered religious geography that persists today.

### 5. Continuous Jewish Presence

Small Jewish communities existed throughout — never numerous, but never absent.

## Narrative Arc for Chapter

### Structure

1. **Opening**: The Arab armies arrive — 636-640 CE
2. **Umayyad transformation**: Dome of the Rock, Arabization begins
3. **Abbasid periphery**: Province of larger empire
4. **Fatimid rule**: Egypt takes control; Hakim's destructions
5. **The Crusades**: European invasion, massacre, Latin Kingdom
6. **Saladin**: Reconquest and relative tolerance
7. **Mamluk consolidation**: Expulsion of Crusaders; stability
8. **Closing**: On the eve of the Ottomans

### Emotional Arc

- **Opening**: Transition — old world ends, new world begins
- **Middle**: Violence and coexistence — Crusades as trauma
- **Closing**: Continuity — the same land, transformed
