# Research Synthesis: WWII, Holocaust, Partition, Nakba (1945-1949)

> **Module**: 08-1948

## Executive Summary

The years 1945-1949 transformed Palestine irrevocably. The Holocaust created desperate urgency for Jewish refuge; Britain withdrew; the UN proposed partition; both sides prepared for war. When Israel declared independence on May 14, 1948, Arab armies invaded. The war resulted in Israeli victory, Arab defeat, and the Nakba — the displacement of 700,000-750,000 Palestinians. By 1949, Israel controlled 78% of Mandate Palestine; Jordan held the West Bank and East Jerusalem; Egypt held Gaza. No peace treaties were signed, only armistices. The conflict was frozen, not resolved.

**Critical finding**: Both peoples experienced 1948 as existential. For Jews, it was survival after the Holocaust and the creation of a state. For Palestinians, it was catastrophe — the destruction of their society and the beginning of exile. Both experiences are real; neither delegitimizes the other.

## Core Thesis

**Two catastrophes, one war.** The Holocaust and the Nakba are not morally equivalent — 6 million murdered is not the same as 700,000 displaced. But both are catastrophes that shape their peoples' consciousness. The tragedy of 1948 is that the aftermath of one catastrophe contributed to another. Holocaust survivors seeking refuge helped create a state whose birth required another people's dispossession. Understanding this requires holding multiple truths simultaneously.

## The Holocaust and Its Aftermath

### The Catastrophe

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Deaths | ~6 million Jews murdered |
| Percentage | ~36% of world Jewish population |
| European Jews | ~60% murdered |
| Survivors | Displaced persons camps; nowhere to go |

### Impact on Palestine Question

1. **Moral urgency**: Jewish need for refuge now undeniable
2. **Survivor destination**: Many sought Palestine
3. **British restrictions**: 1939 White Paper still in effect
4. **International sympathy**: Shifted toward Zionism
5. **Arab objection**: Why should Palestinians pay for European crimes?

### Jewish Displaced Persons

Post-war Europe:
- 250,000+ Jews in DP camps
- Could not/would not return to Poland, Germany, etc.
- Many wanted Palestine
- Britain maintained immigration restrictions
- Illegal immigration (Aliyah Bet) intensified
- Ships turned away (Exodus, 1947)

---

## The Path to Partition

### British Withdrawal

By 1947, Britain was:
- Economically exhausted
- Unable to satisfy either side
- Facing Jewish violence (Irgun, Lehi)
- Under US pressure
- Ready to leave

**February 1947**: Britain referred Palestine to UN.

### UNSCOP Investigation

UN Special Committee on Palestine (1947):
- 11 member states
- Visited Palestine; heard testimonies
- Visited DP camps in Europe
- Majority report: Partition
- Minority report: Federal solution

### UN Resolution 181 (November 29, 1947)

**Partition Plan**:

| Entity | Territory | Population |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Jewish State | 56.5% of Mandate | ~500,000 Jews; ~400,000 Arabs |
| Arab State | 42.9% of Mandate | ~700,000 Arabs; ~10,000 Jews |
| Jerusalem | International corpus separatum | ~100,000 Jews; ~100,000 Arabs |

**Vote**: 33-13-10 (passed)

### Responses

**Jewish Agency**: Accepted (with reservations about boundaries)

**Arab Higher Committee**: Rejected
- No partition acceptable
- Jewish state would include Arab majority areas
- No consent of majority population obtained
- Seen as colonial imposition

**Violence began immediately**: December 1947

## Civil War Phase (November 1947 - May 1948)

### Initial Period (Nov 1947 - March 1948)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Character | Local fighting; Arab offensive |
| Arab advantages | Interior lines; blocking roads |
| Jewish disadvantages | Settlements scattered; supply vulnerable |
| Deaths | Hundreds on each side |

### Turning Point (April 1948)

| Event | Date | Significance |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Operation Nachshon | April 5-20 | Opened road to Jerusalem |
| Qastal Battle | April 8 | Abd al-Qadir al-Husseini killed |
| Deir Yassin | April 9 | Massacre; 100+ villagers killed |
| Haifa | April 21-22 | Arab population fled/expelled |
| Jaffa | April 25-May 13 | Siege and evacuation |

### Plan Dalet (Plan D)

Haganah operational plan (March 1948):

**What it said**:
- Secure territory allocated to Jewish state
- Secure Jerusalem corridor
- Prepare for Arab state invasion

**What it meant** (scholarly debate):
- **Position A**: Defensive; permitted expulsion only if necessary
- **Position B**: Blueprint for ethnic cleansing
- **Position C**: Flexible guidance; local commanders decided

**Result**: Regardless of intent, implementation involved significant expulsions.

### Deir Yassin Massacre (April 9, 1948)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Location | Village near Jerusalem |
| Attackers | Irgun and Lehi |
| Deaths | 100-120 villagers (number disputed) |
| Character | Massacre of civilians |
| Impact | Psychological; contributed to flight |

**Note**: Jewish Agency condemned the massacre; but the psychological effect accelerated Palestinian flight.

### Hadassah Convoy Massacre (April 13, 1948)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Location | Road to Mount Scopus, Jerusalem |
| Victims | Medical personnel and academics |
| Deaths | 78 Jews killed |
| Character | Retaliation for Deir Yassin |

## The Nakba: Causes and Mechanisms

### Scale

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Refugees | 700,000-750,000 Palestinians |
| Villages | 400-500 depopulated |
| Percentage | ~80% of Arab population in Israeli-controlled territory |
| Property | Abandoned; later seized |

### Mechanisms (Morris's Categories)

Based on Benny Morris's research, causes varied by location and time:

| Cause | Percentage (Morris) | Examples |
|-------|-----------------------|----------|
| Jewish military operations | ~55% | Haifa, Jaffa, Lydda |
| Fear and panic | ~25% | Flight before fighting arrived |
| Expulsion orders | ~15% | Lydda, Ramle |
| Arab orders to leave | ~5% | Disputed; less than claimed |
| Psychological warfare | Significant | Deir Yassin amplification |

### Key Debates

**Was it planned?**
- **Pappé**: Yes; "ethnic cleansing" was policy
- **Morris**: Mixed; Plan Dalet enabled but didn't require; local decisions varied
- **Traditional Israeli**: No; Arabs fled voluntarily or on Arab orders

**Were there Arab orders to flee?**
- Traditional claim: Arab leaders told people to leave
- Research: Very limited evidence for this; happened occasionally but was not general policy
- Most flight: Response to fighting, expulsions, fear

### Right of Return

**UN Resolution 194 (December 1948)**:
- Called for return of refugees "wishing to live at peace"
- Israel refused
- Refugees remained in camps in Gaza, West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria
- Issue remains unresolved

| Area | Controller |
|------|------------|
| West Jerusalem | Israel |
| East Jerusalem | Jordan |
| Old City | Jordan |
| Holy sites | Divided; Jews barred from Western Wall |

## Key Findings

### 1. Multiple Causes of Palestinian Displacement

The Nakba resulted from military operations, expulsions, fear, and flight. It was not solely "voluntary" departure or solely planned expulsion — both occurred.

### 2. Both Sides Experienced Trauma

Israeli Jews: Fought for survival after Holocaust; ~6,000 dead (~1% of population).
Palestinians: Lost their homeland; 700,000+ refugees; society destroyed.

### 3. No Peace, Only Armistice

The 1949 armistice lines were not borders. No peace treaties were signed. The conflict was frozen, not resolved.

### 4. The Refugee Problem Was Created

700,000+ Palestinians became refugees. Israel refused return. The refugee issue remains unresolved to this day.

### 5. Israeli Independence and Palestinian Catastrophe Are Inseparable

The same events that created Israel destroyed Palestinian society. Understanding this duality is essential.
