## Module Purpose

This chapter covers the pivotal years 1945-1949, during which:
- WWII ended and the Holocaust's full scale became known
- Britain handed Palestine to the UN
- Resolution 181 proposed partition
- Civil war erupted between Jewish and Arab communities
- Israel declared independence (May 14, 1948)
- Arab states invaded
- The Nakba: 700,000+ Palestinians fled or were expelled
- Armistice lines (not borders) were established

**Key principle**: The events of 1948 are viewed completely differently by Israelis and Palestinians. One people's "War of Independence" is another's "Nakba" (Catastrophe). Both narratives contain truth. The task is to present what happened accurately while acknowledging the divergent meanings.

## Critical Notes

### On Terminology

| Term | User | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| War of Independence | Israel | Birth of the state; defensive war |
| Nakba | Palestinians | Catastrophe; destruction of society |
| 1948 War | Neutral | Descriptive term |
| Ethnic cleansing | Some scholars | Deliberate population removal |
| Population transfer | Other scholars | Less charged term |

### On the "New Historians"

Israeli scholars who opened archives and challenged foundational myths:
- Morris: Palestinians fled AND were expelled; both happened
- Shlaim: Arab states were not coordinated; Jordan colluded with Israel
- Pappé: More explicitly critical; uses "ethnic cleansing"
- Still debated within Israeli and international scholarship

### On Balance

**This module requires extreme care**:
- Both peoples experienced trauma in 1948
- Israeli experience: Existential war; Holocaust survivors fighting for survival
- Palestinian experience: Nakba; society destroyed; exile began
- Neither trauma delegitimizes the other
