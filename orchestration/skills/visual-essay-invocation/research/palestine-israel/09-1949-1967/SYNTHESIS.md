## Executive Summary

The period 1949-1967 was a frozen conflict. Armistice agreements ended fighting but brought no peace treaties. Israel consolidated as a state, absorbing mass immigration including Jews expelled from Arab countries. Palestinian refugees remained in camps, with no resolution in sight. The West Bank was annexed by Jordan; Gaza was administered by Egypt. Border incidents, fedayeen raids, and the 1956 Suez Crisis punctuated the period. By 1967, tensions over water, borders, and Palestinian nationalism led to another war.

## Core Thesis

**Armistice is not peace.** The Green Line created a temporary boundary that became permanent in fact but was never accepted as final by any party. Israel wanted recognition; Arab states wanted justice for Palestinians. Neither came. The period was preparation for the next war, which arrived in 1967.

## Key Findings

1. **No Peace**: Armistice lines ≠ recognized borders
2. **Dual Absorption**: Israel absorbed Jewish refugees; Arab states hosted (but didn't absorb) Palestinian refugees
3. **Frozen Conflict**: Both sides prepared for next war
4. **Palestinian Nationalism**: Crystallized in exile; PLO formed
5. **Cold War Dimension**: US backed Israel; USSR backed Arab states
