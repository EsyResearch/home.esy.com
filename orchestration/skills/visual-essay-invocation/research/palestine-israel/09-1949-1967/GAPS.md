## Key Contested Areas

### Tier 1: Do Not Claim
1. **Precise refugee numbers over time** — estimates vary
2. **"Voluntary" Jewish emigration from Arab countries** — complex; some fled, some expelled
3. **Who started specific border incidents** — often disputed

### Tier 2: Scholarly Debate
1. **Mizrahi Jews as refugees** — Israeli: yes (from Arab persecution); Critics: different from Palestinian refugees
2. **Jordan's West Bank annexation** — Was it colonial? Beneficial? Exploitative?
3. **1956 Suez: Israeli motivations** — Self-defense? Expansion? Colonial adventure?
4. **Arab states' treatment of Palestinians** — Integration vs. deliberate non-absorption

### Tier 3: Politically Contested
1. **Green Line legitimacy** — Israel: not final border; Palestinians: minimum territory
2. **Responsibility for refugee non-resolution** — Israel: Arab states refused resettlement; Arabs: Israel refused return
3. **Military rule of Arab Israelis** — Security necessity or discrimination?

## Terminology Guidance

| Term | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Green Line | 1949 armistice line | Use; note it's armistice, not recognized border |
| Arab Israelis | Can be contested | Use; note also "Palestinian citizens of Israel" |
| Mizrahi | Jews from Arab/Muslim countries | Use; distinct from Ashkenazi |
| Fedayeen | Palestinian fighters | Use; translate as "those who sacrifice" |
| Infiltrators | Israeli term for fedayeen | Note it's Israeli framing |

## Key Principle

**Armistice ≠ Peace.** The 1949 lines were explicitly NOT final borders. No party accepted them as permanent. This matters for understanding both the 1967 war and all subsequent claims about "1967 borders."
