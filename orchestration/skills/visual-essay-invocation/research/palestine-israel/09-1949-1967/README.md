## Module Purpose

This chapter covers the period between the 1948 War and the 1967 War, during which:
- Armistice lines (Green Line) defined borders — but no peace treaties
- Israel absorbed mass Jewish immigration from Arab countries and Europe
- Palestinian refugees lived in camps; no resolution
- Arab states remained at war with Israel (legally)
- The 1956 Suez Crisis occurred
- Tensions built toward 1967

**Key principle**: The 1949 armistice created a frozen conflict, not peace. Both sides prepared for the next round.
