## Overview

This document tracks:
1. Claims we cannot make due to insufficient evidence
2. Claims requiring qualification due to scholarly debate
3. Claims that are historically clear but politically contested
4. Narrative framing risks where even neutral language may appear partisan
5. Active conflict limitations (Module 12 only)

**Purpose**: Prevent orphan claims in the spec. Everything documented here should NOT appear as definitive fact in the visual essay.

## Tier 1 Gaps: Do Not Claim (Insufficient Evidence)

These claims lack adequate primary source support. They should be **excluded entirely** from the essay or mentioned only as "some believe" with explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty.

### Gap 1.1: [Claim Title]

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | [The specific claim that cannot be made] |
| **Why Insufficient** | [What evidence is missing] |
| **What We Know** | [Related facts that ARE verified] |
| **What We Don't Know** | [The specific uncertainty] |
| **Sources Checked** | [Sources consulted that failed to verify] |
| **Recommendation** | Exclude entirely / Mention as uncertain / Use qualifying language |

### Gap 1.2: [Claim Title]
[Repeat structure]

## Tier 2 Gaps: Claim with Qualification (Scholarly Debate)

These claims are actively debated by credentialed historians. Present **multiple scholarly positions** without adjudication.

### Gap 2.1: [Debate Topic]

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | [The contested claim] |
| **Position A** | [First scholarly view] |
| **Position A Proponents** | [Historians/schools holding this view] |
| **Position A Sources** | [Key sources] |
| **Position B** | [Second scholarly view] |
| **Position B Proponents** | [Historians/schools holding this view] |
| **Position B Sources** | [Key sources] |
| **Position C** | [Third view if applicable] |
| **Consensus Status** | Actively debated / Majority view exists / Emerging consensus |
| **Esy Approach** | Present both views neutrally, use "historians debate" language |

### Gap 2.2: [Debate Topic]
[Repeat structure]

## Tier 3 Gaps: Politically Contested (Not Historically Contested)

These claims are **historically clear** based on evidence but **politically disputed** by one or more parties. State the evidence, acknowledge the political contestation exists.

### Gap 3.1: [Topic]

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | [The historically supported claim] |
| **Historical Consensus** | [What evidence clearly shows] |
| **Evidence Base** | [Primary sources supporting this] |
| **Political Contestation** | [Who disputes this and why] |
| **Nature of Dispute** | Factual denial / Interpretation dispute / Framing dispute |
| **Esy Approach** | State evidence, note dispute exists without legitimizing denial of evidence |

### Gap 3.2: [Topic]
[Repeat structure]

## Narrative Framing Risks

Areas where even carefully neutral language may be perceived as partisan. Identify risks and mitigation strategies.

### Risk 1: [Risk Title]

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Description** | [What framing choice creates the risk] |
| **Why Sensitive** | [Why this framing matters to affected communities] |
| **Perspective A** | [How one community may interpret] |
| **Perspective B** | [How another community may interpret] |
| **Mitigation Strategy** | [How to handle in the essay] |
| **Recommended Language** | [Specific phrasing to use] |
| **Language to Avoid** | [Specific phrasing that inflames] |

### Risk 2: [Risk Title]

## Terminology Guidance

Words and phrases requiring careful handling in this module.

| Term | Issue | Recommended Usage | Avoid |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------|
| [Term] | [Why contested] | [How to use] | [What not to say] |

---

## Active Conflict Limitations (Module 12 Only)

For ongoing events that cannot be fully verified due to active conflict conditions.

### Limitation 1: [Topic]

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim Type** | Casualty figures / Event attribution / Intent / Sequence |
| **Verification Challenge** | [Why this cannot be independently verified] |
| **Available Sources** | [What sources exist] |
| **Source Limitations** | [Known gaps or biases in available sources] |
| **Date-Stamp** | [Date of most recent verification attempt] |
| **Esy Approach** | Cite source explicitly, include date, note verification limits |

### Limitation 2: [Topic]

## Impact on Spec Construction

How these gaps affect the invocation spec.

| Gap | Spec Element Affected | Handling |
|-----|----------------------|----------|

| Gap 2.1 | [Chapter/section] | Present debate, no conclusion |
| Gap 3.1 | [Chapter/section] | State evidence, note contestation |
| Risk 1 | [Chapter/section] | Use recommended language |
