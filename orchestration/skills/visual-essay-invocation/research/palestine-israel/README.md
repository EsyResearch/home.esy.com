## Research Standards

### Source Tier Requirements

| Tier | Description | Target % |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Tier 1 | Academic journals, university press, primary archives, encyclopedias | 30%+ |
| Tier 2 | Major news (NYT, Guardian, BBC), reputable publishers, quality magazines | 40%+ |
| Tier 3 | Regional news, expert blogs, Wikipedia (as gateway only) | ≤25% |
| Tier 4 | Social media, partisan advocacy, self-published | 0% |

**Requirement**: 80%+ Tier 1-2 sources overall

### Contested Claim Protocol

For claims where historians disagree:
1. Identify the claim as contested in GAPS.md
2. Source from minimum 2 different traditions
3. Present scholarly positions without adjudication
4. Use qualifying language ("scholars debate," "evidence suggests")

### Active Conflict Protocol (Module 12)

- Date-stamp all current-events claims
- Limit to verified events (major news, UN/humanitarian reports)
- Heavy GAPS.md documentation for unverifiable claims
- No casualty numbers unless from verified humanitarian sources (UN OCHA, ICRC)
- No attribution of intent without direct evidence

## Key Questions This Research Must Answer

1. **Who is "indigenous" to this land?** — Define carefully, show why simplistic answers fail
2. **What has the region been called across time?** — Timeline of names with etymology
3. **Why isn't it always called "Palestine"?** — Trace naming through empires
4. **Critical peoples across history** — Per era, noting ancient ≠ modern identities
5. **Explain the Nakba** — Causes, mechanisms, scale, consequences, scholarly debates
6. **1945 → 1948 pathway** — What happened between WWII end and Israel's creation
7. **Pre-1948 coexistence** — How did communities live together (and apart)?
8. **Why was Israel created?** — Zionism, Holocaust, diplomacy, opposition
9. **How was partition decided?** — UNSCOP, Resolution 181, responses
10. **European imperial role** — Ottoman decline, WWI, mandates, Cold War
11. **Balfour Declaration** — Context, meaning, interpretations
12. **Path to current conflict** — Gaza trajectory, escalation points, current war
