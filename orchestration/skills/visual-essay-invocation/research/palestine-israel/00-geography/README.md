## Module Purpose

This chapter establishes the physical geography of the region as context for all subsequent chapters. The land itself is a historical actor — its position between continents, its water sources, its terrain all shaped who lived there and why empires fought over it.

**Key Questions**:
1. What is the physical geography (topography, climate, water)?
2. Why did this corridor matter between Africa, Asia, and Europe?
3. How did geography shape settlement patterns?
4. What trade routes crossed this land?

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions
1. What are the major geographic regions (coastal plain, hill country, Jordan Valley, Negev)?
2. What is the climate and rainfall pattern?
3. What water sources exist (Jordan River, Sea of Galilee, aquifers)?
4. Why is this land a "land bridge" between continents?

### Secondary Questions
1. How did geography affect ancient trade routes?
2. What strategic locations mattered (ports, mountain passes)?
3. How did rainfall patterns affect agriculture and settlement?
4. What natural resources existed?
