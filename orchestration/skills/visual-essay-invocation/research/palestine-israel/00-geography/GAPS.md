## Overview

Physical geography is among the least contested aspects of this topic. The land's topography, climate, and hydrology are empirically verifiable. However, some framing and terminology choices still carry political implications.

---

## Tier 1 Gaps: Do Not Claim

*No major Tier 1 gaps identified for geography.*

Physical geography facts (elevations, rainfall, river courses) are empirically established and not disputed.

---

## Tier 2 Gaps: Scholarly Debate

### Gap 2.1: Precise Bronze Age Trade Route Courses

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | Exact routes of Via Maris and King's Highway in all periods |
| **Issue** | Routes shifted over time; some segments are reconstructed |
| **Esy Approach** | Present general corridors; note routes varied by period |

---

## Tier 3 Gaps: Politically Contested

### Gap 3.1: Naming the Region in Geographic Context

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Issue** | What to call the region in a "pre-political" geography chapter |
| **Options** | "Southern Levant" (scholarly neutral), "Palestine/Israel region," "the Holy Land" |
| **Scholarly Practice** | Many archaeologists use "Southern Levant" to avoid political connotations |
| **Esy Approach** | Use "Southern Levant" for ancient geography; explain this is the scholarly convention |

### Gap 3.2: Water Resources and Modern Politics

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Issue** | Discussion of water resources touches on modern Israeli-Palestinian disputes |
| **Historical Context** | Water sharing has been contested since ancient times |
| **Modern Context** | Jordan River basin is "most securitized water region in the world" |
| **Esy Approach** | Present geography factually; note water as ongoing concern without detailed policy analysis (save for later chapters) |

## Narrative Framing Risks

### Risk 1: Implying "Empty Land"

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Risk** | Describing geography without mentioning people could imply the land was empty |
| **Mitigation** | Note this chapter focuses on physical geography; people are covered in subsequent chapters |
| **Recommended Language** | "The land that would be inhabited by many peoples over millennia..." |

### Risk 2: "Strategic" Framing

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Risk** | Emphasizing strategic importance could imply the land exists to be conquered |
| **Mitigation** | Balance strategic importance with lived experience of inhabitants |
| **Recommended Language** | Focus on how geography shaped *settlement* and *daily life*, not just conquest |

## Terminology Guidance

| Term | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Southern Levant | Neutral scholarly term | Preferred for ancient geography |
| Palestine/Israel | Modern political terms | Avoid for prehistoric/geographic context |
| Holy Land | Religious framing | Note as religious designation only |
| Promised Land | Religious framing | Do not use in geographic context |
