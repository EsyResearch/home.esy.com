## Tier 1: Do Not Claim
1. **Camp David II "generous offer"** — Details disputed; don't accept either narrative uncritically
2. **Precise casualty figures** — Use verified ranges from human rights organizations
3. **Who "started" Second Intifada** — Proximate trigger (Sharon visit) vs. underlying causes

## Tier 2: Scholarly Debate
1. **Oslo's design flaws** — Inevitable failure vs. could have worked with different leaders
2. **Barak's offer at Camp David** — Generous vs. non-viable state
3. **Arafat's decision-making** — Strategic choice vs. inability to say yes
4. **Hamas's rise** — Response to corruption/Oslo failure vs. ideological commitment

## Tier 3: Politically Contested
1. **Who killed Oslo** — Israel (settlements) vs. Palestinians (violence) vs. both
2. **Second Intifada as "terrorism"** — Armed struggle vs. terrorism; collective punishment
3. **Gaza disengagement** — Step toward peace vs. consolidating control
4. **Hamas legitimacy** — Elected government vs. terrorist organization

## Terminology Guidance

| Term | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Hamas | Use name; note designations (US/EU: terrorist; others: disputed) |
| Terrorism/militants | Describe actions; note terminology contested |
| Occupation | Continued during Oslo; use term |
| Peace process | Can use; note many see it as failure |
| Generous offer | Israeli/US framing; note Palestinian dispute |
| Separation barrier | Israel: "security fence"; Palestinians: "apartheid wall" — use neutral "barrier" |

## Key Principle

**Camp David blame is contested.** Israeli/US narrative blames Arafat for rejecting "generous offer." Palestinian narrative says offer was not viable state. Scholarship increasingly sees both sides' failures. Present both without adjudicating.
