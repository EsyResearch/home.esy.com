## Executive Summary

The Oslo Accords (1993) raised hopes for a two-state solution. The Palestinian Authority was established; Israel and PLO recognized each other. But Oslo was a framework, not a final agreement. Settlements continued growing; violence continued; final status issues were deferred. Rabin's assassination (1995), Netanyahu's election (1996), and the failure of Camp David II (2000) led to the Second Intifada — far deadlier than the first. By 2007, the Palestinian national movement had split: Hamas controlled Gaza; the PA/Fatah controlled parts of the West Bank. The peace process was dead.

## Core Thesis

**Oslo's promise was never fulfilled.** The accords created a Palestinian Authority but not a Palestinian state. Settlements doubled during the "peace process." Neither side got what it needed: Palestinians didn't get a state; Israelis didn't get security. The Second Intifada destroyed trust. By 2007, the two-state solution was in critical condition.

## The Oslo Accords (1993-1995)

**Declaration of Principles (Sept 1993)**:
- Mutual recognition: Israel and PLO
- Palestinian self-governance in stages
- Final status negotiations on: Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, borders
- 5-year interim period

**Oslo II (1995)**:
- West Bank divided: Area A (PA control), B (joint), C (Israeli control)
- PA governed ~40% of West Bank population; ~18% of land
- Settlements remained; expanded

**What Oslo Didn't Do**:
- Define Palestinian state borders
- Resolve Jerusalem
- Address refugees (Resolution 194)
- Stop settlements

## Rabin Assassination (November 4, 1995)

**The Event**:
- Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin assassinated by Israeli extremist Yigal Amir
- Amir opposed Oslo; saw Rabin as traitor
- Profound shock to Israeli society

**Consequences**:
- Peres government (briefly)
- Netanyahu elected 1996; Oslo process slowed
- Lost the Israeli leader most committed to territorial compromise

---

## Camp David II (July 2000)

**Clinton-Barak-Arafat Summit**:

**Israeli Offer** (disputed details):
- ~90-94% of West Bank (after annexation of settlement blocs)
- Palestinian state in Gaza and West Bank
- Jerusalem division (contested formulas)
- Limited refugee return

**Palestinian Position**:
- Offer was less than appeared (territorial discontinuity)
- Jerusalem proposals inadequate
- Refugee issue not addressed sufficiently

**Outcome**: No agreement. Blame contested.
- Israeli/US narrative: Arafat rejected generous offer
- Palestinian narrative: Offer was not viable state; Israel blamed victim

---

## Second Intifada (2000-2005)

**Trigger**: Sharon's Temple Mount visit (Sept 28, 2000)

**Character**: Much more violent than First Intifada
- Suicide bombings in Israeli cities
- Israeli military operations in Palestinian areas
- ~1,000 Israelis killed; ~3,000 Palestinians killed

**Key Events**:
- 2002: Passover bombing; Operation Defensive Shield
- 2002: Jenin battle (massacre accusations disputed; UN report: not massacre but serious violations)
- 2002-2005: Separation barrier construction begins

**End**: Ceasefire 2005; Arafat's death (2004); Abbas elected

---

## Gaza Disengagement (August 2005)

**Sharon's Decision**:
- Unilateral withdrawal from Gaza
- All settlements removed (~8,000 settlers)
- No agreement with Palestinians
- Israel retained control of borders, airspace, coast

**Israeli Perspectives**:
- Left: Step toward peace
- Right: Abandonment; security risk

**Palestinian Perspectives**:
- Not liberation; Gaza became prison
- No control of borders
- Led to Hamas rise

---

## Hamas Election and Split (2006-2007)

**2006 Elections**: Hamas won Palestinian Legislative Council elections
- Free elections; Hamas majority
- International reaction: Isolation; aid cut
- Unity government attempts failed

**2007 Split**:
- Hamas-Fatah conflict in Gaza
- Hamas took control of Gaza (June 2007)
- PA/Fatah retained West Bank (under occupation)
- Palestinian national movement divided

**Gaza Blockade**:
- Israel and Egypt imposed blockade (2007)
- Justified as security measure against Hamas
- Critics: Collective punishment; humanitarian crisis

---

## Key Findings

1. **Oslo was process, not peace** — Final status never agreed
2. **Settlements continued growing** — Doubled during peace process
3. **Violence destroyed trust** — Second Intifada far deadlier
4. **Palestinian division** — Hamas/Gaza; PA-Fatah/West Bank
5. **Two-state solution endangered** — Facts on ground changed calculus
