## Special Requirements

### 1. Multi-Tradition Sourcing

**Requirement**: Every contested claim must have sources from at least 2 different institutional traditions.

**Traditions Defined**:
- Israeli (academic, archival, governmental)
- Palestinian (academic, archival, official)
- International (third-party academic, UN, IGOs)
- Arab (non-Palestinian Arab institutional)
- Jewish Diaspora (non-Israeli Jewish institutional)
- British Colonial (Mandate-era British sources)
- Ottoman (Ottoman-era archival)

**Implementation**: CITATIONS.md template includes tradition field for every source.

### 2. Explicit Tradition Labeling

**Requirement**: All sources labeled with institutional tradition in CITATIONS.md.

**Purpose**: Transparency about source perspectives; enables reader assessment.

### 3. Enhanced GAPS.md

**Requirement**: Three-tier gap classification:
- Tier 1: Do Not Claim (insufficient evidence)
- Tier 2: Claim with Qualification (scholarly debate)
- Tier 3: Politically Contested (historically clear, politically disputed)

**Additional Sections**:
- Narrative Framing Risks
- Terminology Guidance
- Active Conflict Limitations (Module 12)

### 4. Active Conflict Protocols (Module 12)

**Requirements**:
- Date-stamp all current-events claims
- Limit to verified events (major news, UN/humanitarian reports)
- Heavy GAPS.md documentation for unverifiable claims
- No casualty numbers unless from verified humanitarian sources (UN OCHA, ICRC)
- No attribution of intent without direct evidence
- Distinguish facts from allegations

### 5. No Visual Inspiration from Existing Essays

**Requirement**: Design Research (Gate 4) must derive all visual identity from subject matter only.

**Prohibited**:
- Reading existing visual essay implementations
- Copying patterns from prior essays
- Using existing essays as templates

**Permitted**:
- Subject matter visual archaeology
- Era-appropriate research
- Archival photography study

## Key Questions This Research Must Answer

### Core Questions (From Prompt)

1. **Who is "indigenous" to this land?**
   - Define "indigenous" carefully
   - Show why simplistic single-group answers fail
   - Address continuity and diaspora

2. **What has the region been called across time?**
   - Timeline of names (administrative, geographic, political)
   - Who used each name and why

3. **Why isn't it always called "Palestine"?**
   - Etymology: Peleset → Philistines → Palaistinē → Palaestina → Filastin → Palestine
   - Usage shifts by empire, language, governance

4. **List the critical peoples across history**
   - Concise lists per era
   - Note: ancient ≠ modern identities

5. **Explain the Nakba**
   - Definition and dates (1947-1949)
   - Causes and mechanisms
   - Scale and consequences
   - Scholarly debates

6. **Clarify the 1945 → 1948 pathway**
   - WWII ends 1945; Israel declared 1948
   - What happened between (DPs, British policy, partition, civil war)

7. **Pre-1948 coexistence**
   - How did communities live together?
   - Mixed cities, rural life, cooperation
   - Rising tensions, riots, movements

8. **Why was Israel created?**
   - Zionism origins
   - European antisemitism and Holocaust
   - Self-determination movement
   - International diplomacy
   - Arab and Palestinian opposition

9. **How was partition decided?**
   - UNSCOP process
   - UNGA Resolution 181 (1947)
   - Demographic/land factors
   - Competing proposals
   - Why it failed to prevent war

10. **European imperial role**
    - Ottoman decline
    - European interests (strategic, oil)
    - WWI impacts
    - Mandate system

11. **Balfour Declaration**
    - Context and text
    - Legal/political implications
    - Different interpretations

12. **Path to current conflict**
    - Gaza trajectory (2005-2024)
    - Hamas and Israeli policy
    - Escalation points
    - Current war dynamics

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Scope creep | High | High | Strict module boundaries, gate enforcement |
| Source availability | Medium | Medium | Multi-tradition sourcing, GAPS.md |
| Contested claims | High | High | Present debate, no adjudication |
| Bias perception | High | High | Explicit tradition labeling, multi-perspective |
| Active conflict verification | High | High | Date-stamp, verified sources only |
| Visual identity copying | Low | Medium | Design Research from subject only |
| Reader offense | Medium | Medium | Conflict-sensitive language, dignity |
