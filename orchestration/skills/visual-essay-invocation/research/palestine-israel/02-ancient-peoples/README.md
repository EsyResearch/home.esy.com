## Module Purpose

This chapter documents the succession and mixture of peoples in the region during the Iron Age (~1200-63 BCE). Key principle: **ancient peoples do NOT map neatly onto modern national identities**.

**Critical Note**: This is among the most politically sensitive modules. Every claim must be carefully sourced, and gaps/debates clearly documented.

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions
1. Who were the Canaanites and what happened to them?
2. How did Israelite/Judahite identity emerge?
3. Who were the Philistines and what is their legacy?
4. How did regional empires (Assyria, Babylon, Persia) reshape the population?

### Secondary Questions
1. What is the relationship between Canaanites and later populations?
2. How did the kingdoms of Israel and Judah function?
3. What was the Babylonian exile and its impact?
4. What continuities exist across the Iron Age?
