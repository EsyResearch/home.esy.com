# Research Gaps: 1967 to Oslo (1967-1993)

> **Module**: 10-occupation

---

## Tier 1: Do Not Claim
1. **Precise casualty figures** for various conflicts — use ranges
2. **Israeli "knowledge" of Sabra/Shatila** — indirect responsibility established, direct complicity debated
3. **PLO "terrorism" as blanket characterization** — armed struggle vs. terrorism terminology loaded

## Tier 2: Scholarly Debate
1. **Was 1967 war defensive or expansionist?** — Israel preempted real threat vs. manufactured crisis
2. **Settlement intent** — Security vs. ideology vs. facts on ground
3. **First Intifada's role in Oslo** — Direct cause vs. one factor among many
4. **Camp David's failure on Palestinians** — Sadat's betrayal vs. pragmatic separate peace

## Tier 3: Politically Contested
1. **"Occupation" vs. "disputed territories"** — International consensus vs. Israeli position
2. **Settlement legality** — Geneva Convention vs. Israeli legal arguments
3. **East Jerusalem status** — Annexed vs. occupied
4. **Two-state solution viability** — Still possible vs. settlements killed it

## Terminology Guidance

| Term | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Occupation | Use; note Israel disputes terminology |
| Settlements | Use; note Israeli term "communities" |
| West Bank | Use; note Israeli "Judea and Samaria" |
| Green Line | 1949 armistice line; 1967 border |
| Intifada | "Uprising"; Arabic term widely used |
| Territories | "Occupied territories" per international law |

## Key Principle

**International law vs. Israeli position diverge.** The international community (including ICJ) considers the territories occupied and settlements illegal. Israel disputes this. Present both positions; note the international consensus.
