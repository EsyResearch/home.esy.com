## Executive Summary

The 1967 Six-Day War transformed the conflict. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza, Sinai, and Golan Heights — tripling its controlled territory and placing millions of Palestinians under military occupation. What was intended as "bargaining chips" became permanent occupation. Settlements grew from a few outposts to major population centers. The 1973 war led to the Camp David peace with Egypt (returning Sinai). The 1987 First Intifada — a Palestinian popular uprising — eventually pushed both sides toward Oslo.

## Core Thesis

**Occupation became permanent.** In 1967, Israeli leaders debated whether to return territories for peace. By 1993, 100,000+ settlers lived in the West Bank and Gaza. What began as military occupation transformed into facts on the ground that made withdrawal increasingly difficult.

## The 1967 Six-Day War

**Prelude**:
- Soviet misinformation about Israeli troop buildup
- Nasser closed Straits of Tiran (May 22)
- Egypt-Jordan defense pact (May 30)
- Israel: Existential threat; preemptive war justified
- Arabs: Israeli aggression

**The War (June 5-10, 1967)**:
- Israeli preemptive strike destroyed Egyptian air force
- West Bank captured (Jordan)
- Gaza and Sinai captured (Egypt)
- Golan Heights captured (Syria)
- Old City of Jerusalem captured; Jews return to Western Wall

**UN Resolution 242 (Nov 1967)**:
- "Withdrawal from territories" (ambiguous: "the" territories vs. "territories")
- "Right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries"
- Land for peace formula
- Basis for all subsequent negotiations

## The Occupation

### Legal Status (Contested)

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| **International consensus** | Occupied territory under Fourth Geneva Convention |
| **Israeli position** | "Disputed" not "occupied"; Jordan's claim was illegitimate |
| **ICJ Advisory Opinion (2004)** | Occupation; settlements illegal; wall illegal |

### Settlement Enterprise

**Timeline**:
- 1967: First settlements (Kfar Etzion, Hebron)
- 1977: Likud government; settlement expansion accelerates
- 1993 (Oslo): ~110,000 settlers in West Bank/Gaza
- Today: 700,000+ settlers in West Bank and East Jerusalem

**Motivations**:
- Security (strategic depth)
- Religious (biblical lands)
- Political (facts on the ground)
- Economic (subsidized housing)

### Palestinian Life Under Occupation

- Military administration
- Permits required for movement, building, work
- Land confiscation for settlements
- Detention without trial
- Economic restrictions
- Collective punishment

## 1973 Yom Kippur War

**The War**:
- Egypt and Syria surprise attack (October 6)
- Initial Arab success; Israeli counterattack
- US airlift saved Israel
- UN ceasefire (October 25)

**Consequences**:
- Arab honor restored (could fight Israel)
- Israel's invincibility myth shattered
- Led to Camp David negotiations

---

## Camp David Accords (1978)

**Egypt-Israel Peace**:
- Sadat visited Jerusalem (1977) — historic
- Carter mediated Camp David
- Full peace treaty (1979)
- Israel returned Sinai
- Egypt recognized Israel
- Cold peace; but no more wars

**Palestinian dimension**:
- Discussed autonomy, not statehood
- Never implemented
- Other Arab states isolated Egypt

---

## Lebanon Wars

**1978 Operation Litani**: Limited incursion; south Lebanon buffer zone

**1982 Lebanon War**:
- Full invasion; reached Beirut
- PLO expelled to Tunisia
- Sabra and Shatila massacre (Lebanese Christian militia; Israeli responsibility debated)
- Israeli occupation of south Lebanon until 2000

---

## First Intifada (1987-1993)

**Causes**:
- 20 years of occupation
- No political horizon
- Settlement expansion
- Daily humiliations

**Character**:
- Popular uprising (not PLO-organized initially)
- Strikes, boycotts, stone-throwing
- Civil disobedience
- Youth leadership

**Israeli Response**:
- Rabin's "break their bones" policy
- Mass arrests
- Curfews
- Deportations

**Outcomes**:
- ~1,100 Palestinians killed; ~160 Israelis killed
- Changed international perception
- Empowered local Palestinian leadership
- Created conditions for Oslo

---

## Path to Oslo

**Developments**:
- 1988: PLO declares independence; accepts 242; recognizes Israel's right to exist
- 1991: Madrid Conference (US-sponsored; multilateral)
- 1991: USSR collapse; US sole superpower
- 1992: Rabin elected; more pragmatic
- 1993: Secret Oslo negotiations → Declaration of Principles

---

## Key Findings

1. **Occupation intended as temporary became permanent**
2. **Settlements created "facts on the ground"**
3. **International law says occupation; Israel disputes**
4. **First Intifada changed dynamics**
5. **Oslo emerged from exhaustion on both sides**

- **Who started 1967**: Israel preempted, but under what threat?
- **Occupation vs. disputed**: Legal status contested
- **Settlement legality**: International consensus vs. Israeli position
