## Executive Summary

The British Mandate period (1917-1947) was defined by an irreconcilable contradiction: Britain promised both a "Jewish national home" (Balfour Declaration) and protection of "civil and religious rights" for existing inhabitants. As Jewish immigration transformed demographics and Arab resistance grew, British policy oscillated between the two communities. The 1936-1939 Arab Revolt was suppressed, and the 1939 White Paper restricted Jewish immigration just as the Holocaust made refuge most desperate. After WWII, with Jewish survivors demanding entry and both sides engaging in violence, Britain handed the problem to the UN. Resolution 181 proposed partition; neither side fully accepted it; the Mandate ended in war.

**Critical finding**: The Mandate period made conflict highly likely. British promises were incompatible. One people's national home meant another's dispossession. By 1947, the question was not whether there would be conflict, but what form it would take.

## Core Thesis

**Incompatible promises, inevitable collision.** The Balfour Declaration promised Jews a "national home" while pledging that "nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities." This was contradiction, not compromise. A Jewish national home with immigration sufficient to create a majority would inevitably transform Palestine fundamentally. British attempts to balance these promises satisfied no one and delayed resolution until violence forced their departure.

## WWI and the Balfour Declaration

### The Wartime Context

Britain made overlapping and contradictory promises during WWI:

| Promise | Date | To Whom | Content |
|---------|------|---------|---------|
| McMahon-Hussein | 1915-1916 | Sharif Hussein | Arab independence (Palestine status disputed) |
| Sykes-Picot | 1916 | France | Division of Ottoman territories |
| Balfour Declaration | 1917 | Zionists | Jewish national home in Palestine |

### The Balfour Declaration (November 2, 1917)

**Full text**:
> "His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."

**Key features**:
- "National home" — deliberately ambiguous (not "state")
- "In Palestine" — not "of Palestine"
- "Existing non-Jewish communities" — 90% of population not named
- Promised nothing would "prejudice" their rights

### Why Britain Issued It

Multiple motivations (scholarly debate on relative weight):
- **Wartime diplomacy**: Win Jewish support worldwide
- **Biblical romanticism**: Christian Zionism in British culture
- **Imperial strategy**: Protect Suez Canal approach
- **Personal beliefs**: Balfour and others sympathized with Zionism
- **Antisemitism**: Some British officials wanted Jews to go elsewhere

### The Conquest

| Event | Date | Details |
|-------|------|---------|
| Battle of Beersheba | October 1917 | British advance begins |
| Balfour Declaration | November 2, 1917 | Promise issued before conquest complete |
| Allenby enters Jerusalem | December 11, 1917 | Ottoman rule ends |
| Armistice | October 1918 | War ends |
| Mandate begins | 1920 (formal 1922) | League of Nations approves |

---

## The Mandate System

### Legal Framework

The League of Nations Mandate (1922) incorporated Balfour Declaration:
- Britain as "mandatory power"
- Obligation to facilitate Jewish immigration
- Obligation to protect existing population's rights
- Sacred trust: prepare territory for independence

### British Administration

| Office | First Holder | Role |
|--------|--------------|------|
| High Commissioner | Herbert Samuel (1920-1925) | Chief administrator |
| Military administration | Various | Security forces |
| District officers | Various | Local governance |

**Notable**: Herbert Samuel was himself Jewish and a Zionist — first Jewish ruler in Palestine in 2,000 years.

## Jewish Immigration (Aliyah)

### Waves of Immigration

| Aliyah | Period | Numbers | Origin | Character |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Third | 1919-1923 | ~40,000 | Eastern Europe | Post-WWI; Labor Zionism |
| Fourth | 1924-1929 | ~82,000 | Poland | Middle class; urban |
| Fifth | 1929-1939 | ~250,000 | Germany, Eastern Europe | Nazi rise; desperate |
| Aliyah Bet | 1939-1948 | ~100,000 | Europe | Illegal; Holocaust survivors |

### Demographic Transformation

| Year | Jews | Muslims | Christians | Total | Jewish % |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------|----------|
| 1922 | 84,000 | 589,000 | 73,000 | 757,000 | 11% |
| 1931 | 175,000 | 760,000 | 89,000 | 1,036,000 | 17% |
| 1936 | 384,000 | 848,000 | 106,000 | 1,367,000 | 28% |
| 1947 | 630,000 | 1,181,000 | 143,000 | 1,970,000 | 32% |

**Critical transformation**: From 11% to 32% Jewish in 25 years.

## Palestinian Arab Politics

### Leadership Structure

**Husayni faction**:
- Haj Amin al-Husseini: Grand Mufti (appointed 1921)
- Supreme Muslim Council
- More militant; no compromise

**Nashashibi faction**:
- Raghib al-Nashashibi: Mayor of Jerusalem
- National Defense Party
- More moderate; willing to negotiate

### Arab Responses

| Year | Event | Response |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1920 | Nebi Musa riots | Protest; violence |
| 1921 | Jaffa riots | Violence; British restrict immigration briefly |
| 1929 | Hebron/Western Wall riots | 67 Jews killed; 116 Arabs killed by British |
| 1936-1939 | Arab Revolt | Major national uprising |

### The 1929 Riots

Sparked by disputes over Western Wall access:
- **Hebron massacre**: 67 Jews killed by Arab rioters
- **British response**: 116 Arabs killed; Shaw Commission
- **Result**: Passfield White Paper (1930) — later reversed

## The 1936-1939 Arab Revolt

### Causes

- Continued immigration (especially from Nazi Germany)
- Land sales and peasant displacement
- Failure of political approaches
- Regional Arab nationalism influence
- Izz ad-Din al-Qassam's example (killed 1935)

### Phases

| Phase | Period | Character |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| General Strike | April-October 1936 | Nonviolent; economic |
| Peel Commission | 1936-1937 | Investigation; partition proposal |
| Full Revolt | 1937-1939 | Armed rebellion; British crackdown |

### Peel Commission (1937)

First formal partition proposal:
- Small Jewish state (coastal)
- Arab state joined to Transjordan
- British corridor (Jerusalem-Jaffa)
- Population transfer proposed

**Responses**:
- Zionist movement: Divided; some accepted as foothold
- Arabs: Rejected; no partition acceptable
- British: Eventually abandoned

### British Suppression

- 20,000+ troops deployed
- Collective punishment (house demolitions, curfews)
- Detention without trial
- ~5,000 Arabs killed; ~400 Jews; ~200 British
- Arab leadership decimated or exiled
- Palestinian society weakened before 1948

## The White Paper and WWII

### The 1939 White Paper

As WWII approached, Britain sought Arab support:

| Provision | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| Immigration | 75,000 over 5 years, then Arab consent required |
| Land sales | Restricted in most areas |
| Independence | Within 10 years; neither Jewish nor Arab state |

**Zionist response**: Betrayal; Ben-Gurion: "We will fight the White Paper as if there were no war, and fight the war as if there were no White Paper."

**Arab response**: Too late; still rejected as insufficient.

### WWII Period

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Jewish support | 30,000 Palestinian Jews enlisted in British forces |
| Arab neutrality | Mixed; some pro-Axis |
| Mufti and Nazis | Al-Husseini in Berlin; met Hitler; SS recruitment |
| Jewish underground | Irgun suspended attacks (1940-1944); Lehi did not |

### The Holocaust

- 6 million European Jews murdered
- Drastically increased urgency for Jewish refuge
- Survivors seeking entry to Palestine
- Britain maintained immigration restrictions
- Ships turned away (Struma, Exodus)

---

## Post-War Crisis (1945-1947)

### Jewish Underground Violence

| Group | Ideology | Key Actions |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Haganah | Mainstream Labor Zionism | Self-defense; later offensive operations |
| Irgun | Revisionist | King David Hotel (1946); prison breaks |
| Lehi (Stern Gang) | Maximalist | Assassinations; Moyne murder (1944) |

**King David Hotel (July 22, 1946)**: Irgun bombed British HQ; 91 killed (British, Arab, Jewish).

### British Exhaustion

By 1947, Britain was:
- Economically drained by WWII
- Unable to satisfy either side
- Facing Jewish violence
- Facing international (US) pressure
- Ready to leave

### UNSCOP and Partition

**UN Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP)** - 1947:
- Investigated situation
- Majority: Partition into Jewish and Arab states
- Minority: Federal solution

**UN Resolution 181 (November 29, 1947)**:
- Jewish state: 56% of territory (including Negev)
- Arab state: 43% of territory
- Jerusalem: International zone (corpus separatum)
- Economic union between states

**Vote**: 33-13-10 (passed)

---

## Responses to Partition

### Jewish Response

- **Jewish Agency**: Accepted (grudgingly; boundaries not ideal)
- **Celebrations**: Dancing in streets of Tel Aviv
- **Preparation**: Military and administrative planning for statehood

### Arab Response

- **Arab Higher Committee**: Rejected; no partition acceptable
- **Arab states**: Rejected; threatened intervention
- **Violence**: Attacks began immediately after vote

### Why Arabs Rejected

- Partition gave 56% to 32% of population
- Jewish state included areas with Arab majorities
- No consent of indigenous majority
- Seen as colonial imposition

---

## Key Findings

### 1. The Mandate Was Contradictory

The Balfour Declaration's two promises could not both be fulfilled. A Jewish national home with significant immigration was incompatible with protecting Arab rights.

### 2. Demographics Transformed Rapidly

Jewish population grew from 11% to 32% in 25 years — fast enough to be threatening but not fast enough for a stable majority.

### 3. The 1936-1939 Revolt Weakened Palestinians

British suppression devastated Palestinian leadership and society, leaving them ill-prepared for 1948.

### 4. The Holocaust Changed Everything

WWII and the Holocaust made Jewish refuge urgent while Britain maintained immigration restrictions, radicalizing Jewish politics.

### 5. Partition Was Rejected by Arabs

UN Resolution 181 was seen as illegitimate imposition. Arabs were expected to accept loss of majority territory without consent.
