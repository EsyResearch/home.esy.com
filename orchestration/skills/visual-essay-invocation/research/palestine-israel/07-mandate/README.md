## Module Purpose

This chapter covers the British Mandate period (1917-1947), during which:
- Britain conquered Palestine from the Ottomans (WWI)
- The Balfour Declaration promised a "Jewish national home"
- Mass Jewish immigration transformed demographics
- Palestinian Arab resistance grew
- British policy oscillated between promises to both sides
- WWII and the Holocaust changed everything
- Britain handed the problem to the UN

**Key principle**: The British Mandate contained inherent contradictions — promises to both Jews and Arabs that could not both be fulfilled. The period set the stage for 1948.

## Critical Notes

### On the Balfour Declaration

The Declaration is interpreted very differently:
- **Zionist view**: Legitimate promise; recognition of Jewish rights
- **Palestinian view**: Colonial betrayal; promise of someone else's land
- **Historical view**: British wartime diplomacy with multiple motivations

### On the 1936-1939 Arab Revolt

This was a major event in Palestinian history:
- National uprising against British rule and Zionism
- British suppressed it violently
- Weakened Palestinian leadership before 1948
- Sometimes called the "first intifada"

### On the Mufti and Nazis

Haj Amin al-Husseini's WWII collaboration with Nazi Germany:
- Documented meetings with Hitler
- Recruitment for SS
- Highly controversial
- Does NOT represent all Palestinians
- Often weaponized in modern propaganda
