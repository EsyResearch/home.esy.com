## Tier 1 Gaps: Do Not Claim

| **Recommendation** | Use "approximately" and cite ranges |

### Gap 1.2: McMahon-Hussein Palestine Commitment

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | Whether McMahon promised Palestine to Arabs |
| **Why Insufficient** | The text is ambiguous; Arabs and British interpret differently |

| **Recommendation** | Present the ambiguity; note the ongoing dispute |

### Gap 1.3: Extent of Zionist-Nazi Collaboration

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | Details of Ha'avara (Transfer Agreement) |

## Tier 2 Gaps: Scholarly Debate

### Gap 2.1: Why Britain Issued the Balfour Declaration

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | What motivated the Balfour Declaration |
| **Position A** | Genuine sympathy for Zionism; biblical resonance |
| **Position B** | Wartime diplomacy; win Jewish support |
| **Position C** | Imperial strategy; protect Suez |
| **Position D** | Antisemitism; encourage Jews to leave Europe |
| **Current View** | Combination of factors; relative weight debated |
| **Esy Approach** | Present multiple motivations; avoid single explanation |

### Gap 2.2: Character of the Arab Revolt

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | How to characterize 1936-1939 |
| **Position A** | National liberation movement |
| **Position B** | Anti-Jewish violence; proto-fascist elements |
| **Position C** | Complex: genuine national movement with violent elements |
| **Current View** | Position C — both nationalist and violent |
| **Esy Approach** | Present as national uprising; acknowledge violence against Jews; note British violence in suppression |

### Gap 2.3: Was Partition Viable?

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Claim** | Whether 1947 partition could have worked |
| **Position A** | Could have worked if Arabs had accepted |
| **Position B** | Structurally unworkable; too mixed populations |
| **Position C** | Counterfactual unknowable |

| **Esy Approach** | Present Palestinian political divisions; note constraints; avoid hindsight judgment |

## Tier 3 Gaps: Politically Contested

### Gap 3.1: Legitimacy of Balfour Declaration

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Issue** | Whether Britain had right to promise Palestine |
| **Israeli Position** | International recognition of Jewish connection; legitimate promise |
| **Palestinian Position** | Colonial imposition; promising what Britain didn't own |
| **Scholarly Position** | Both aspects: reflected imperial power AND recognized Jewish claims |
| **Esy Approach** | Present the Declaration in its imperial context; note both its power and its presumption |

### Gap 3.2: Mufti and Nazi Germany

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Issue** | How to treat al-Husseini's Nazi collaboration |
| **Israeli Political Use** | Frequent citation to delegitimize Palestinians |
| **Palestinian Political Use** | Minimize, contextualize, or note he was one figure among many |
| **Historical Evidence** | Met Hitler; recruited for SS; broadcast Nazi propaganda |
| **Scholarly Position** | Collaboration is documented; does NOT represent all Palestinians |
| **Esy Approach** | Document the collaboration factually; note it was one leader's choice; avoid attributing to all Palestinians |

### Gap 3.3: Jewish Underground Violence

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Issue** | How to characterize Irgun/Lehi actions |
| **Israeli Traditional View** | Freedom fighters; necessary pressure for statehood |
| **Palestinian View** | Terrorism |
| **Scholarly Position** | Terrorism by most definitions; targeted civilians for political aims |
| **Esy Approach** | Describe actions factually; note King David Hotel, Deir Yassin, etc.; use neutral language |

### Gap 3.4: Resolution 181 Legitimacy

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Issue** | Whether UN partition was legitimate |
| **Israeli Position** | International legal foundation for Israel |
| **Palestinian Position** | Illegitimate; no consent of majority population |
| **Scholarly Position** | General Assembly resolutions are recommendations, not binding law; implementation required consent |
| **Esy Approach** | Present the resolution; note it was recommendation, not enforcement; present both responses |

### Gap 3.5: "Voluntary" Jewish Immigration

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Issue** | Whether Jewish immigration was colonial or refugee flight |
| **Israeli Position** | Refugees escaping persecution; return to homeland |
| **Palestinian Position** | Colonial settlement regardless of motivation |
| **Scholarly Position** | Both: genuine refugees AND settlers in existing society |
| **Esy Approach** | Present persecution context AND demographic impact; both are true |

## Narrative Framing Risks

### Risk 1: Presenting Balfour as Solely Colonial

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Risk** | Ignoring Jewish persecution that made refuge urgent |
| **Mitigation** | Present both imperial context AND Jewish need |
| **Recommended Language** | "In the context of European antisemitism and WWI diplomacy..." |

### Risk 2: Presenting Balfour as Solely Humanitarian

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Risk** | Ignoring that Britain promised land where others lived |
| **Mitigation** | Note the existing population and colonial context |
| **Recommended Language** | "...promising a national home in territory where 90% of inhabitants were Arab" |

### Risk 3: Arab Revolt as Solely Violent

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Risk** | Ignoring the political and national dimensions |
| **Mitigation** | Present as national movement with violent tactics |
| **Recommended Language** | "The revolt was both a national uprising and a violent campaign..." |

### Risk 4: Mufti as Representative

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Risk** | Suggesting Mufti's choices represent all Palestinians |
| **Mitigation** | Note he was one leader; many Palestinians had different views |
| **Recommended Language** | "The Mufti, one Palestinian leader among several..." |

### Risk 5: Holocaust as Justifying Partition

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Risk** | Implying that Holocaust justified taking Arab land |
| **Mitigation** | Present Holocaust and partition separately; note both Jewish need and Arab objection |
| **Recommended Language** | "The Holocaust created urgent need for Jewish refuge. Partition assigned this burden to Palestinian Arabs, who had not caused the Holocaust." |

## Terminology Guidance

| Term | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| National home | Ambiguous | Note ambiguity; not the same as "state" |
| Terrorism | Loaded | Describe actions; note debate over term |
| Freedom fighters | Loaded | Avoid unless quoting; describe actions instead |
| Revolt/Rebellion | 1936-1939 | "Arab Revolt" is common; note it was also called "Great Revolt" |
| Partition | 1937, 1947 | Use for both proposals |
| White Paper | Multiple | Specify which one (1922, 1930, 1939) |
| Aliyah | Zionist term | Use with translation ("immigration" or "ascent") |
| Settlers/Immigrants | Both applicable | Use "immigrants" for pre-state; note both terms apply |

## Key Principle for This Module

**The Mandate contained irreconcilable promises.**

Britain promised Jews a national home AND promised to protect Arab rights. One could not be fulfilled without compromising the other. This was not failed diplomacy but structural contradiction. Understanding this helps explain why all parties — British, Jewish, and Arab — ended the period dissatisfied, and why the Mandate ended not with agreement but with war.

Neither side was simply wrong. Jews fleeing persecution needed refuge. Arabs living in Palestine had not caused European antisemitism and reasonably objected to bearing its costs. The tragedy was structural, not moral failure by any one party.
