## Module Purpose

This chapter covers the emergence of competing nationalisms (~1880-1917), during which:
- Modern Zionism emerged as a political movement (Herzl, Basel Congress 1897)
- Arab nationalism developed (Nahda, Young Arab movements)
- Palestinian political consciousness began to crystallize
- European antisemitism drove Jewish emigration eastward
- The stage was set for the British Mandate and modern conflict

**Key principle**: Nationalism is modern. Both Zionism and Palestinian nationalism are 19th-20th century phenomena. Neither is "invented" — all nationalisms are constructed. Neither is less legitimate for being modern.

## Critical Notes

### On Zionism and Colonialism

This is a major scholarly and political debate:
- **One view**: Zionism was a form of European colonialism
- **Another view**: Zionism was a national liberation movement
- **Scholarly position**: Both framings capture aspects; Zionism had characteristics of both settler colonialism and national return

### On Palestinian Nationalism

- Modern national identity is a 20th century development
- This doesn't make it less real or legitimate
- All nationalisms are "constructed" — this is not a criticism

### On Religious vs. Political Zionism

- Religious longing for Zion predated political Zionism by millennia
- Political Zionism was largely secular in origin
- Religious Zionism developed as a distinct stream
- These distinctions matter for understanding the movement
