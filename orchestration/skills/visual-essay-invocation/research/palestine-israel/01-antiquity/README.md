## Module Purpose

This chapter establishes what we can *actually say* from archaeology and early written records — not myth, not religious tradition, but verifiable material evidence. The goal is to ground the reader in archaeological reality before later chapters introduce competing narratives.

**Key Principle**: Evidence-first. Archaeology tells us about material culture, settlement patterns, and trade. It cannot "prove" religious narratives.

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions
1. What is the earliest evidence of human habitation in the region?
2. What do we know about Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlement?
3. What was the Bronze Age urban civilization like?
4. What can we say about early writing and trade?
5. What does archaeology tell us about the Late Bronze Age collapse?

### Secondary Questions
1. What are the major archaeological sites and what have they revealed?
2. How did the region connect to Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Anatolia?
3. What do we know about religion in this period from material evidence?
4. What are the limits of archaeological interpretation?

## Critical Note

**This chapter focuses on what archaeology can and cannot tell us.** It should NOT be used to "prove" modern political claims. Ancient material culture does not confer modern political rights.
