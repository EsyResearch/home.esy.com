## Executive Summary

The Roman and Byzantine periods (~63 BCE - 638 CE) fundamentally reshaped the region. Roman conquest brought the province into the Mediterranean imperial system. Two major Jewish revolts (66-73 CE, 132-135 CE) resulted in the destruction of the Temple, massive population loss, the renaming of the province to "Syria Palaestina," and the growth of diaspora communities — though Jewish populations remained, especially in Galilee. Under Byzantine rule, the region became the Christian "Holy Land," with pilgrimage, church-building, and a new religious geography. The Arab conquest of 636-640 CE ended this era.

**Critical finding**: The diaspora was not a single event of expulsion but a gradual process across centuries. Jews remained in the region throughout; the idea of "complete exile" is historically inaccurate.

## Core Thesis

**Rome created "Palestine" as a political entity.** The name "Palaestina" — derived from "Philistia" — was applied by Roman administration after 135 CE. This was not an invention but an adoption of existing Greek geographic terminology (Herodotus used "Palestine" in the 5th century BCE). The Romans imposed this name administratively on what they had called "Judaea." This is neither a "proof" of Palestinian indigeneity nor a "delegitimization" of Jewish connection — it is simply how the name came to be applied.

## Roman Conquest and Herodian Period

### Pompey's Conquest (63 BCE)

- Roman general Pompey conquered Jerusalem during Roman civil wars
- Judaea became a Roman client state
- Beginning of Roman domination that lasted 700 years
- Local elites maintained power under Roman supervision

### Herod the Great (37-4 BCE)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Rule | Roman-appointed client king |
| Building Projects | Second Temple expansion, Caesarea Maritima, Masada, Herodium |
| Significance | Transformed the region's infrastructure; Temple became monumental |
| Legacy | "Herodian period" in archaeology |

### Direct Roman Rule

After Herod's death (4 BCE), the region was divided among his sons, then increasingly placed under direct Roman rule:
- Judaea proper under Roman prefects/procurators (6 CE onwards)
- Pontius Pilate served as prefect (26-36 CE)
- Rising tensions between Jewish population and Roman administration
- Tax burden, cultural friction, messianic expectations

## The Jewish-Roman Wars

### First Jewish-Roman War (66-73 CE)

**The Great Revolt**

| Phase | Events |
|-------|--------|
| 66 CE | Revolt begins in Caesarea; spreads to Jerusalem; Roman garrison expelled |
| 67-68 CE | Vespasian campaigns in Galilee; Josephus captured |
| 69 CE | Vespasian becomes emperor; Titus takes command |
| 70 CE | Jerusalem besieged and captured; Second Temple destroyed (9th of Av) |
| 73 CE | Masada falls — last holdout |

**Consequences**:
- Temple destroyed — never rebuilt
- Jerusalem devastated
- Significant population loss (Josephus claims 1.1 million dead, likely exaggerated)
- Jewish religious life transforms — synagogue replaces Temple; rabbinical Judaism emerges
- First major wave of diaspora expansion

### The Kitos War (115-117 CE)

- Diaspora Jewish revolt in Cyprus, Cyrenaica, Egypt
- Suppressed by Trajan
- Increased tensions in Judaea

### Bar Kokhba Revolt (132-135 CE)

**The Final Revolt**

| Cause | Hadrian's plans to rebuild Jerusalem as Roman city "Aelia Capitolina" and possibly ban circumcision |
|-------|------|
| Leader | Simon bar Kokhba (acclaimed as messiah by Rabbi Akiva) |
| Duration | 132-135 CE |
| Scale | Major revolt; rebels held territory for ~3 years |
| Outcome | Catastrophic defeat; Bar Kokhba killed at Betar |

**Hadrian's Response**:

1. **Jerusalem renamed**: "Aelia Capitolina" (after Hadrian's family name Aelius)
2. **Jews banned from Jerusalem**: Could only enter on 9th of Av to mourn
3. **Province renamed**: From "Judaea" to "Syria Palaestina"
4. **Jewish practices restricted**: Circumcision, Torah study reportedly banned (later relaxed)
5. **Massive casualties**: Ancient sources claim 580,000 killed (likely exaggerated but scale was enormous)

## The Naming of "Syria Palaestina"

### Etymology

| Term | Origin | Usage |
|------|--------|-------|
| Palaestina | From Greek "Palaistine" | Herodotus (~450 BCE) used for coastal region |
| Philistia | Hebrew/Semitic | Land of the Philistines (coastal cities) |
| Syria Palaestina | Latin administrative name | Post-135 CE Roman province |

### Scholarly Debate on Motivation

**Traditional view**: Hadrian renamed the province to erase Jewish connection, using the name of ancient enemies (Philistines).

**Revisionist view**: The term was already in Greek geographic use; renaming may have been administrative reorganization as much as punishment.

**Current consensus**: The renaming was real and occurred under Hadrian; punitive intent is likely given the context of brutal suppression, but the name itself predated Hadrian in Greek usage.

### What This Does NOT Mean

- Does NOT mean modern Palestinians "descend from Philistines" — they do not
- Does NOT mean Jews have no historical connection — they do
- Does NOT adjudicate modern political claims
- DOES explain how the name "Palestine" became attached to the region administratively

## Jewish Population After 135 CE

### The Myth of Complete Expulsion

**Common misconception**: Jews were completely expelled from the region in 70 or 135 CE.

**Historical reality**:
- Jews were banned from Jerusalem specifically, not the entire province
- Jewish communities continued in Galilee (Sepphoris, Tiberias)
- The Mishnah was compiled in Galilee (~200 CE)
- The Jerusalem Talmud was compiled in Galilee (~400 CE)
- Jewish communities persisted throughout Byzantine and Islamic periods

### Diaspora Growth

The revolts accelerated but did not create the diaspora:
- Diaspora communities existed before 70 CE (Alexandria, Rome, Babylon)
- Post-70 CE: Major expansion of diaspora
- Post-135 CE: Further expansion; center of Jewish life shifts to Babylon and diaspora communities
- Continuous Jewish presence in the region, though diminished

## Byzantine Period (324-638 CE)

### Christianization

**Constantine's revolution** (312-337 CE):
- Christianity legalized (Edict of Milan, 313 CE)
- Imperial patronage of Christian holy sites
- Helena's pilgrimage (~326-328 CE) — identified holy sites

**Transformation of the landscape**:
- Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Jerusalem)
- Church of the Nativity (Bethlehem)
- Hundreds of churches and monasteries built
- Region becomes "Holy Land" — Terra Sancta

### Pilgrimage

Major pilgrimage accounts document the transformation:
- *Itinerarium Burdigalense* (333 CE) — earliest Christian pilgrim account
- Egeria's *Itinerarium* (late 4th century) — detailed description of holy sites
- *Piacenza Pilgrim* (6th century)

### Population in Byzantine Period

| Group | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Christians | Dominant; Greek Orthodox majority; various communities |
| Jews | Minority; restricted but present; Galilee center |
| Samaritans | Significant population; later revolted |
| Pagans | Declining; eventually suppressed |

### Samaritan Revolts

- 484 CE: First Samaritan revolt
- 529-531 CE: Major Samaritan revolt; brutal suppression
- Samaritan population drastically reduced
- Shows that non-Christian populations faced persecution

### End of Byzantine Rule

**Persian Invasion (614 CE)**:
- Sasanian Persians conquered Jerusalem
- Church of the Holy Sepulchre damaged
- Jews briefly allied with Persians
- Byzantine reconquest (628 CE)

**Arab Conquest (636-640 CE)**:
- Battle of Yarmouk (636 CE) — decisive Byzantine defeat
- Jerusalem surrendered (638 CE) — Caliph Umar
- End of 700 years of Roman/Byzantine rule
- Beginning of Islamic period

## Key Findings

### 1. The Name "Palestine" is Roman Administrative

The province name "Syria Palaestina" was imposed by Hadrian in 135 CE. The term existed in Greek usage earlier (Herodotus), derived from "Philistia." This is historical fact, not modern political construction.

### 2. Diaspora Was Gradual, Not a Single Event

Jewish diaspora predated 70 CE and expanded gradually. Jews were not completely expelled; communities remained, especially in Galilee. The idea of "complete exile" is historically inaccurate.

### 3. Religious Transformation Under Byzantines

The region's identity was fundamentally reshaped by Christianization. The concept of "Holy Land" as pilgrimage destination was a Byzantine creation.

### 4. Continuity and Change

Despite catastrophic revolts, population continuity existed. Jews, Samaritans, and eventually Christians lived in the region throughout. No single group was completely replaced.

### 5. Violent Suppression Was Real

The Jewish revolts were suppressed with extreme violence. Casualty figures are debated but were enormous. This trauma shaped Jewish memory and diaspora identity.

## Key Quotes

> "Jerusalem... was so thoroughly razed to the ground by those that demolished it to its foundations, that nothing was left that could ever persuade visitors that it had once been a place of habitation." — Josephus, *Jewish War* (on 70 CE destruction)

> "In the course of the war 580,000 Jews were killed in the various raids and battles, and the number of those that perished by famine, disease and fire was past finding out." — Cassius Dio (on Bar Kokhba revolt; likely exaggerated)
