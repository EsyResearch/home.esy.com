## Module Purpose

This chapter covers the Roman and Byzantine periods (~63 BCE - 638 CE), during which:
- The region was incorporated into the Roman Empire
- The Second Temple was destroyed (70 CE)
- The name "Palaestina" was officially applied (after 135 CE)
- Jewish diaspora communities formed while some Jews remained
- Christianity transformed the region into the "Holy Land"

**Key principle**: The renaming to "Palaestina" happened under Roman administration; this is a historical fact, not a modern political claim.

## Critical Notes

### On the Palaestina Naming

The renaming of Judaea to Syria Palaestina after 135 CE is:
- **Historically documented**: This is not contested
- **Politically charged**: Modern actors invoke this history in different ways
- **Complex in motivation**: Scholarly debate exists on Hadrian's exact intent

### On Jewish Population Post-135 CE

Common misconception: All Jews were expelled in 135 CE.
Scholarly consensus: Jewish communities continued in Galilee and elsewhere; diaspora grew but some Jews remained.

### On Byzantine "Holy Land"

The transformation of Palestine into Christian holy sites occurred under Byzantine rule. This shaped the region's character for centuries and continues to matter today.
