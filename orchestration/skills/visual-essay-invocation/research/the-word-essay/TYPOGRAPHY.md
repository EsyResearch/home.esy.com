  - Graceful, calligraphic forms
  - Visible pen influence in curves
  - Slight stress angle (not fully vertical)

## Typeface Recommendations for Production

### Primary Typefaces to Source

**For Authenticity**:

4. **Let typography breathe** — generous whitespace
5. **Animate thoughtfully** — morph between forms to show evolution
