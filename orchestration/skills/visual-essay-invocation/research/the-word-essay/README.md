## Key Findings Summary

### Etymology Chain
**Latin** *exigere* (to drive out, examine, test) → *exagium* (a weighing) → **Old French** *essayer* (to try, attempt) → **Montaigne** *Essais* (1580) → **English** "essay"

### Core Insight
The word "essay" means "attempt" or "trial" — Montaigne's genius was naming his works after the *process* of thinking, not the *product* of thought. This embedded humility into the literary form's very identity.

2. Francis Bacon (1561-1626) — Brought form to English
3. Joseph Addison (1672-1719) — Periodical essay (The Spectator)
4. Richard Steele (1672-1729) — Co-founder of periodical essay
5. Charles Lamb (1775-1834) — Personal/familiar essay tradition
