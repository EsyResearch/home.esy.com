# Research Gaps: The Word "Essay"

## What We Could Not Verify

This document records research gaps — claims we cannot make without additional verification, imagery we may not be able to source, and areas requiring further investigation.

---

## Gap Category 1: Imagery Licensing

### Modern Figure Photography

**Issue**: Several 20th-21st century figures have portraits under copyright.

| Figure | Primary Image | Status | Risk Level |
|--------|---------------|--------|------------|
| Virginia Woolf | Beresford 1902 | ⚠️ Some copyrighted | LOW — many public domain options |
| George Orwell | Press photos | ⚠️ Many copyrighted | MEDIUM — fewer alternatives |
| James Baldwin | Civil Rights era | ⚠️ Most copyrighted | HIGH — licensing required |
| Joan Didion | Julian Wasser 1968 | ⚠️ Under copyright | HIGH — iconic but expensive |

**Mitigation**:
- Use public domain alternatives where available
- Budget for licensing key images
- Consider illustration for problematic portraits
- Focus visual attention on earlier eras where imagery is free

### First Edition Scans

**Issue**: High-resolution scans of *Essais* (1580) first edition may require institutional permission.

**Sources to Contact**:
- Bibliothèque municipale de Bordeaux
- University of Chicago Montaigne Studies
- Christie's for auction materials

**Risk Level**: LOW — academic use likely permissible

---

## Gap Category 2: Typography Verification

### Exact Typeface of 1580 *Essais*

**Issue**: While we know Simon Millanges printed the *Essais*, the exact typeface used (whether Garamond or a derivative) is not 100% confirmed.

**What We Know**:
- French Renaissance printing typically used Garamond-style types
- The general appearance matches Garamond characteristics
- Wood-engraved bands and initials confirmed

**What We Don't Know**:
- Exact punch source for Millanges' type
- Whether it was genuine Garamond or a similar French Roman

**Mitigation**:
- Use "Garamond-style" language rather than asserting "Garamond"
- Visual authenticity achieved with Adobe Garamond Pro or EB Garamond

**Risk Level**: LOW — distinction is typographically minor

---

## Gap Category 3: Quote Sourcing

### All Core Quotes Verified ✅

No significant gaps in quote verification. All 13 core quotes have sources.

### Secondary Quotes

**Issue**: Some commonly attributed quotes may be paraphrased or misattributed:

| Quote | Attribution | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| "To be yourself in a world..." | Emerson | ⚠️ Attributed, exact source unclear |
| "Not everything that is faced can be changed..." | Baldwin | ⚠️ Widely attributed, verify exact source |

**Mitigation**:
- Use "attributed to" language
- Or omit in favor of definitively sourced quotes

**Risk Level**: LOW — these are secondary quotes, not central

---

## Gap Category 4: Historical Details

### Montaigne's Tower Library

**Issue**: The tower library as it exists today is reconstructed. Original interior may have differed.

**What We Know**:
- Montaigne retired to his tower library in 1571
- He inscribed Greek and Latin maxims on ceiling beams
- Some beams with inscriptions survive

**What We Don't Know**:
- Precise original arrangement
- Exact visual appearance in 1580

**Mitigation**:
- Use language like "Montaigne's tower, where he wrote..." rather than claiming visual accuracy
- Modern photographs acceptable with acknowledgment

**Risk Level**: LOW — contextual, not central claim

### Coffeehouse Reading Practices

**Issue**: While *The Spectator* was read in coffeehouses, exact reading practices are partially reconstructed.

**What We Know**:
- Circulation ~3,000, readership much larger
- Coffeehouses as social reading venues
- Essays designed for quick consumption

**What We Don't Know**:
- Precise circulation in specific coffeehouses
- Reading aloud vs. silent reading proportions

**Mitigation**:
- Use general claims ("widely read in coffeehouses")
- Avoid specific claims without sources

**Risk Level**: LOW — general context is well-established

---

## Gap Category 5: Scope Limitations

### Non-Western Essay Traditions

**Issue**: This essay focuses on the Western essay tradition (French → English → American). Non-Western essayistic forms are out of scope but exist.

**Examples Not Covered**:
- Japanese zuihitsu (随筆) — "follow the brush" essays (Sei Shōnagon, c. 1002)
- Chinese prose traditions
- Arabic/Persian reflective prose

**Mitigation**:
- Acknowledge Western focus in essay framing
- Future expansion opportunity noted

**Risk Level**: LOW — scope is clearly defined

### Contemporary Essayists

**Issue**: Essay stops at Didion (1934-2021). Many significant contemporary essayists not covered.

**Examples Not Covered**:
- Ta-Nehisi Coates
- Zadie Smith
- Roxane Gay
- John Jeremiah Sullivan
- Leslie Jamison

**Mitigation**:
- Digital era (final chapter) acknowledges continuity
- "Infinite forms" language covers expansion

**Risk Level**: LOW — closing loop works without naming every contemporary

---

## Gap Category 6: Technical Verification

### Video Essay Etymology

**Issue**: When exactly "video essay" as a term emerged is undocumented in this research.

**What We Know**:
- Video essays prominent by 2010s (Every Frame a Painting, etc.)
- Term applies "essay" to visual medium

**What We Don't Know**:
- First documented use of "video essay"
- Academic vs. popular origin

**Mitigation**:
- Use general language ("emerged in the 2010s")
- Not a central claim

**Risk Level**: LOW — peripheral to main narrative

---

## Summary: What NOT to Claim

Based on gaps, avoid these specific claims:

| Do NOT Claim | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| "Garamond typeface was used" | Say "Garamond-style" instead |
| Exact coffeehouse circulation numbers | Use "widely read" |
| Tower library appeared exactly like [image] | Say "Montaigne's tower library, where he wrote..." |
| [Quote] — Emerson (without "attributed") | Some secondary quotes need qualification |
| "First video essay" timing | Use "emerged in the 2010s" |

## Overall Gap Assessment

| Category | Gap Count | Severity | Mitigation Possible |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| Imagery Licensing | 4 figures | MEDIUM | ✅ Yes — budget or alternatives |
| Typography | 1 minor | LOW | ✅ Yes — language adjustment |
| Quote Sourcing | 0 major, 2 minor | LOW | ✅ Yes — attribution language |
| Historical Details | 2 minor | LOW | ✅ Yes — language adjustment |
| Scope | 2 (by design) | N/A | N/A — intentional scope |
| Technical | 1 minor | LOW | ✅ Yes — general language |

**Overall Research Confidence**: HIGH

All core claims are verified. Gaps are peripheral or mitigable.

## Recommendations for Spec Construction

1. **Imagery**: Plan for licensing budget OR design around public domain figures
2. **Typography**: Use "Garamond-style" language for 1580 era
3. **Quotes**: All 13 core quotes are verified; use freely
4. **Scope**: Frame as "Western essay tradition" explicitly
5. **Modern Figures**: Focus scroll-lock sequences on earlier eras where imagery is unrestricted
