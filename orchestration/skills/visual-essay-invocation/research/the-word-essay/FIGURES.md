# Key Figures: The Word "Essay"

## Figure Profiles

### 1. Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) — The Father of the Essay

**Epithet**: The man who gave thinking its humblest name

**Biographical Summary**:
Born Michel Eyquem in the Château de Montaigne in the Périgord region of France. Served as magistrate in Bordeaux, later mayor of the city. Retreated to his tower library in 1571 to write and think. Died February 13, 1592.

**Key Contributions**:
- Coined the term "Essais" (attempts/trials) in 1580, creating a new literary form
- Published first two books of *Essais* in Bordeaux by printer Simon Millanges
- Adopted the motto "Que sais-je?" (What do I know?) — skepticism as method
- Pioneered self-examination as philosophical inquiry
- Wrote 107 essays across three books, continuously revised until death

**Defining Quotes**:
> "I am myself the matter of my book."
> — *Essais*, "To the Reader"

> "Que sais-je?" (What do I know?)
> — His personal motto, emblematic of intellectual humility

**Significance to Essay Form**:
Montaigne didn't just write essays — he named the form. By calling his works "attempts," he embedded humility into the genre's identity. The essay became not a declaration of truth but a *trying out* of ideas.

**Photography/Portraiture**:
- Most famous portrait: Montaigne in his study, attributed to Thomas de Leu (engraving, c. 1596)

### 2. Francis Bacon (1561–1626) — The English Pioneer

**Epithet**: The man who brought the essay across the Channel

**Biographical Summary**:
English philosopher, statesman, scientist, and author. Served as Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of England. Considered a founder of the scientific method. Published first English essays in 1597.

**Key Contributions**:
- Published *Essayes* in 1597 — first collection of essays in English
- Transformed the form: Montaigne's meandering introspection became Bacon's pointed aphorisms

**Defining Quotes**:
> "Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested."
> — "Of Studies"

> "Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man."
> — "Of Studies"

**Significance to Essay Form**:
Where Montaigne was discursive and personal, Bacon was concise and didactic. He created a second mode for the essay — the essay as counsel, as distilled wisdom.
