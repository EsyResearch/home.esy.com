# Research Package: Why Venezuela Matters — Oil, Refineries, and Power in the Western Hemisphere

> **Generated**: January 3, 2026
> **Depth Mode**: Deep
> **Domain Lenses**: Geopolitics + Energy + History + Current Events
> **Update Layer**: Operation Absolute Resolve (January 3, 2026)

## Overview

This research package supports an **Evergreen Visual Systems Essay** that explains Venezuela's structural importance to global energy systems, U.S. refining infrastructure, and hemispheric power dynamics—with a time-sensitive update layer anchored to Operation Absolute Resolve (the U.S. military capture of President Nicolas Maduro on January 3, 2026).

### Truth Discipline

This essay explains the systems behind the headlines. Where facts are still developing, we label them explicitly and cite primary reporting.

**Non-negotiables:**
- No invented facts, quotes, numbers, or "specific-but-unsourced" details
- Separate "confirmed," "reported," and "uncertain/contested"
- If a high-stakes claim cannot be verified with credible sources, it must be labeled uncertain and moved to the Claim Registry
- Calm, objective tone—no propagandistic framing, celebration, or dehumanization
- No sensational imagery (no gore, no raid theatrics)—use systems visuals and restrained UI

## Narrative Arc

```
FRAMING: Why Venezuela matters as a SYSTEM (not just a headline)

ACT I: THE RESOURCE (Wonder → Complexity)
├── Geography: Caribbean proximity, Orinoco Belt
├── 303 billion barrels (world's largest reserves)
├── BUT: Heavy sour crude ≠ light sweet
└── The refinery mismatch problem

ACT II: THE INFRASTRUCTURE (Systems → Stakes)
├── Gulf Coast refineries: built for heavy crude
├── U.S. produces light, needs heavy
├── Canada, Mexico, Venezuela as sources
├── What happens when supply narrows

ACT III: THE POWER STRUCTURE (History → Present)
├── Monroe Doctrine → Trump Corollary
├── Chavez → Maduro timeline
├── Sanctions architecture
├── External alliances (China, Russia, Iran, Cuba)

ACT IV: THE OPERATION (Facts → Uncertainties)
├── What's confirmed (capture, charges, transport)
├── What's reported (details, casualties)
├── What's unknown (ground control, next steps)
├── Legality debates (domestic + international)

ACT V: THE STAKES (Consequences → Watchlist)
├── Why this is NOT Iraq (and what could still go wrong)
├── What a "clean exit" would require
├── Information integrity (how to evaluate claims)
├── International reaction mechanics
└── What to watch next
```

## Research Quality Summary

- **Source Count**: 35+ sources identified
- **Tier Distribution**: 80%+ Tier 1-2
- **Primary Documents**: EIA data, UN Charter text, War Powers Resolution, DOJ indictments
- **Wire Service Verification**: Reuters, AP as primary event sources
- **Disinformation Warning**: Active AI-generated content circulation documented

## Usage Notes

This package supports construction of a six-layer invocation specification. The essay must:

1. **Open with systems, not violence** — Start with a tanker tracker, refinery operator, or policy staffer scene
2. **Maintain dual layers** — Evergreen systems + time-sensitive update
3. **Flag uncertainties visibly** — Use "What We Know / What We Don't Know" blocks
4. **Cite conservatively** — No claims beyond verified sources
5. **Visual restraint** — Diagrams and maps, not sensational imagery
