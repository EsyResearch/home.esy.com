### 3. Center Dignity
- Resistance figures given visual prominence
- Those who fought back are the heroes
- Design serves their stories

### 4. Balance Harm and Response
- For every image of oppression, show resistance
- Never leave viewers with only despair
- Arc moves toward hope while acknowledging ongoing struggle
