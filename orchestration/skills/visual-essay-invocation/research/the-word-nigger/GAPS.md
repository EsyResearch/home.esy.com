# Research Gaps & Limitations

## ⚠️ Content Advisory

This document identifies limitations in research for a documentary essay on a racial slur. Gaps are documented to prevent unsupported claims.

---

## Purpose

This document serves three functions:
1. **Prevent overclaiming**: Identify what cannot be definitively stated
2. **Guide further research**: Note what would strengthen the essay
3. **Maintain scholarly integrity**: Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly

---

## CRITICAL: Claims to Avoid

### These assertions CANNOT be made based on current research:

| Claim Type | Why Problematic | Alternative Framing |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| "The first person to use the slur was..." | Oral usage predates written record | "The earliest written attestation is..." |
| "The word was always considered offensive" | Early usage context unclear | "The word's offensiveness crystallized through..." |
| "X individual 'invented' or 'popularized' the slur" | Oversimplifies diffuse cultural processes | "X's work contributed to normalization" |
| "Reappropriation is empowering/harmful" (as absolute) | Contested within communities | "Reappropriation remains debated, with some arguing..." |
| Quantitative claims without data | Requires corpus analysis | Qualify with "in surveyed texts" or similar |
| Speaking for Black communities | Outsider cannot dictate | Cite community voices directly |

---

## Gap 1: Pre-Written Usage

### The Issue
The word's oral usage certainly preceded its written documentation. We cannot know when the shift from "neutral descriptor" to "slur" occurred in spoken language.

### What We Know
- First OED written attestation: 1574 ("Negar")
- Latin *niger* was neutral color term
- Shift to pejorative occurred during/through slave trade

### What We Don't Know
- When exactly oral usage became common
- Regional variations in early adoption
- Whether there was a "neutral" period in English or immediate pejorative use

### Recommendation
Frame as: "The earliest *written* attestations appear in the 1570s. Oral usage likely predated this and may have varied by region and context."

---

## Gap 2: Individual Attribution

### The Issue
No single individual "invented" or "popularized" the slur. The process was collective, diffuse, and tied to institutions (slave trade, minstrelsy, law).

### What We Know
- Thomas Rice popularized minstrelsy (1830s)
- D.W. Griffith spread racist imagery to mass audiences (1915)
- Specific legal cases codified racial hierarchy

### What We Don't Know
- The precise mechanism of spread
- How to weight individual vs. institutional responsibility
- Whether any single figure had decisive influence

### Recommendation
Focus on institutional and cultural processes rather than individual blame. When naming individuals, frame as "contributed to normalization" rather than "invented/popularized."

---

## Gap 3: Private vs. Public Usage

### The Issue
Corpus data (books, newspapers) captures *public, published* usage. Private speech, oral culture, and intra-community usage are not reflected in these datasets.

### What We Know
- Google Ngram and Chronicling America show published frequency
- Slave narratives document some oral usage
- Hip-hop lyrics capture later oral culture

### What We Don't Know
- Private usage patterns (then or now)
- How public norms affected private speech
- Intra-community usage before recording era

### Recommendation
All frequency claims should specify: "in published/public texts" or "in the surveyed corpus." Include disclaimer that data reflects published language, not private speech.

---

## Gap 4: Global Cognates

### The Issue
The essay focuses on U.S. history but acknowledges global spread. Local histories of cognates (British *nigger*, South African contexts, Brazilian Portuguese) require specialist knowledge.

### What We Know
- The term spread through British Empire
- Cognates exist in multiple languages
- Local histories vary significantly

### What We Don't Know (without specialist research)
- Precise local usage patterns in each context
- Whether trajectories paralleled or diverged from U.S.
- Contemporary status in each context

### Recommendation
- Note that global parallels exist
- Clearly distinguish U.S. focus
- Do not flatten different histories into single narrative
- If including global content, consult regional specialists or qualify as preliminary

---

## Gap 5: Reappropriation Complexity

### The Issue
Reappropriation debates are ongoing, contested, and vary by generation, geography, and individual. Outsiders cannot definitively characterize community consensus.

### What We Know
- Some have reclaimed variants ("nigga") as solidarity/affection
- Others reject any use of the term
- Generational divides exist
- Scholarly frameworks exist (Smitherman, etc.)

### What We Don't Know (from outside position)
- Current community consensus (if any)
- How to weight different voices
- Whether reclamation is "working"

### Recommendation
- Present as documented debate, not resolved question
- Center Black voices and scholarship
- Avoid prescriptive statements about what communities "should" do
- Acknowledge that this section requires particular humility

---

## Gap 6: Contemporary Usage Data

### The Issue
Google Ngram ends in 2019. Chronicling America ends in 1963. Contemporary usage patterns (especially online) are harder to quantify.

### What We Know
- Changed public norms (term rarely used in mainstream media)
- Continued use online and in private
- Ongoing debates in education, entertainment, social media

### What We Don't Know
- Quantitative contemporary frequency
- Platform-specific patterns
- Trend direction in recent years

### Recommendation
Contemporary section should be qualitative rather than quantitative. Note that data constraints limit frequency analysis for recent decades.

---

## Gap 7: Image Availability

### The Issue
Some ideal images may not exist, may be lost, or may require licensing that affects publication.

### Known Availability Issues

| Image Type | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Pre-1900 portraits | Generally available | Public domain |
| Minstrel materials | Available with caution | Sensitive handling required |
| Lynching imagery | Available but restricted | Extreme care required |
| Mid-20th century figures | Mixed | Some require licensing |
| Contemporary figures | License required | Getty, AP, etc. |
| Specific archival documents | Verification needed | Some may not exist digitally |

### Recommendation
- Prioritize public domain and CC-licensed materials
- Budget for licensing if contemporary photography needed
- Have backup visual approaches if specific images unavailable
- Never fabricate or generate "historical" images

---

## Gap 8: Scholarly Debates

### The Issue
Scholarly interpretations vary. Not all historians agree on every point.

### Known Debates

| Topic | Debate |
|-------|--------|
| Minstrelsy's role | Was it purely oppression or also complex cultural exchange? |
| Reappropriation | Empowering or perpetuating harm? |
| "Neutral" period | Was the term ever truly neutral in English usage? |
| Censorship vs. documentation | Should the word appear in educational materials? |

### Recommendation
- Acknowledge scholarly debates where they exist
- Don't present contested interpretations as settled fact
- Cite specific scholars and their positions
- Let readers understand that interpretation varies

---

## Gap 9: Living History

### The Issue
The essay covers ongoing events. Perspectives may shift. New developments may occur.

### Implications
- Any "contemporary" section will date quickly
- Claims about "current" debates may become historical
- New scholarship may emerge

### Recommendation
- Date contemporary sections clearly
- Build for updateability
- Avoid claims about "where we are now" that may age poorly
- Focus on documented patterns rather than predictions

---

## Verification Checklist

Before making any claim, verify:

- [ ] Is this documented in a Tier 1-2 source?
- [ ] Have I checked GAPS.md to see if this is a known limitation?
- [ ] Am I speaking for communities I don't belong to?
- [ ] Is this quantitative claim supported by data I've seen?
- [ ] Could this be reframed with appropriate qualification?

---

## What Remains Strong

Despite these gaps, the research strongly supports:

| Claim | Confidence | Sources |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Latin etymology (*niger* = black) | HIGH | OED, all etymological sources |
| Earliest English attestation (1574) | HIGH | OED with citation |
| Entrenchment through slavery/Jim Crow | HIGH | Extensive primary sources |
| Dictionary evolution (absence → condemnation) | HIGH | Dictionary records |
| Resistance throughout history | HIGH | Documented figures and movements |
| Contemporary offensiveness | HIGH | Dictionary consensus, cultural norms |
| Reappropriation exists and is debated | HIGH | Documented, though details contested |

---

## Recommendations for Production

### Before Spec Construction
1. Verify all FIGURES.md claims against primary sources
2. Confirm image availability for key visuals
3. Check that no claims fall into "avoid" categories

### During Production
1. Flag any claims that require additional verification
2. Consult specialists for global/reappropriation sections
3. Build in editorial review for sensitivity

### Post-Production
1. Expert review before publication
2. Community sensitivity read
3. Citation audit per orchestrator protocol
