## Ethical Framework (Non-Negotiable)

### Purpose Statement
This work exists for **historical-linguistic analysis and cultural documentation**, not provocation. Every design choice, visual selection, and narrative decision must serve understanding, not shock.

### Language Policy

| Context | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| Primary source quotations | Full term permitted (cited) |
| Dictionary entries | Full term permitted (dated) |
| Direct historical evidence | Full term permitted (sourced) |
| Narration and headings | "The N-word" or equivalent |
| Display typography | NEVER use full term as visual shock |

### Required Content Warning
The essay MUST begin with:
> A brief, respectful content warning acknowledging the subject matter and its weight, before any visual or textual content.

### Visual Ethics
- **No sensationalism**: Design cannot glamorize, sensationalize, or exploit
- **No shock typography**: The word cannot be used as visual spectacle
- **Balance required**: Document both the weaponization AND resistance, regulation, condemnation, and debate
- **Dignity centered**: Those targeted by this word are humans, not exhibits

### Evidence Standard
**Every major claim must be supported with citations to credible sources.** No assertions without scholarly backing. Uncertainty must be acknowledged.

## Research Targets (From SKILL.md Requirements)

### Layer 4: Figure Profiles
**Target**: 10-20 key figures with verified documentation

Two categories required:
1. **Spreaders/Normalizers**: Those who popularized, normalized, or weaponized the term in mass culture, politics, or law (documented with scholarly sources only)

- [ ] At least one verified quote where possible

### Layer 4: Timeline/Events
**Target**: Comprehensive chronological map from origins to present

**Requirements**:

## Etymology Deep Dive Requirements

### Linguistic Root and Pathways

Research must document:
1. **Ultimate origin**: Latin *niger* (black) — neutral color descriptor
2. **Romance language development**: Spanish *negro*, Portuguese *negro*, French *nègre*
3. **Pathway into English**: When, how, and through what colonial/trade contexts
4. **Earliest English attestations**: Specific texts, dates, spellings
5. **Spelling variants**: nigger, negar, neger, niger, etc. — with dates for each

### Semantic Evolution

Document the shift from:
- **Neutral descriptor** (if ever truly neutral in English)
- **Racial category term** (classification language)
- **Weaponized slur** (dehumanization tool)

Include scholarly frameworks:
- Semantic pejoration / degradation
- Sociolinguistic context of power
- Euphemism treadmill concept

### Lexicography Snapshots

Create a timeline of dictionary definitions:
- Earliest dictionary appearances (which dictionaries, what dates)
- Evolution of definitions
- Addition of usage labels ("vulgar," "offensive," "taboo," etc.)
- Modern dictionary approaches (censoring, context notes)

**Visual requirement**: Reproduce (or describe for sourcing) scanned/public-domain dictionary pages with micro-captions explaining changes.
