## Key Lexicographic Observations

### 1. The Euphemism Entry Phenomenon

Modern dictionaries have added entries for "the N-word" itself:

**Merriam-Webster's "the N-word"**:
> "the word nigger — used in reference to the word rather than as the word itself"

**Significance**: The euphemism has become lexicalized—a word referring to another word, acknowledging that the original cannot be spoken casually.

---

### 2. Historical Context Notes

Modern dictionaries increasingly include notes explaining:
- Why the term appears in historical texts
- How to handle quotation in educational contexts
- The difference between documentary and slur use

---

### 3. Pronunciation Guides and Variants

Dictionaries now document:
- Standard pronunciation
- Variant spellings (historical): negar, niger, nigar
- Reclaimed pronunciation: "nigga" as distinct from "nigger"
