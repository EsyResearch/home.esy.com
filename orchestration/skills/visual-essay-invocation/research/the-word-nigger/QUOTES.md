### Merriam-Webster's Usage Note (Current)

> **Usage of Nigger**: Nigger in senses 1 and 2 can be found in the works of such writers of the past as Joseph Conrad, Mark Twain, and Charles Dickens, but it now ranks as perhaps the most offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English... Its use by and among black people is not always intended or taken as offensive, but... it is otherwise a word expressive of racial hatred and bigotry.

**Source**: *Merriam-Webster's Dictionary Online*, usage note for "nigger"  
**Context**: Modern dictionary approach to contextualizing a term too historically significant to omit but too offensive to define without warning.  
**Use**: Contemporary lexicographic practice

## Category 2: Resistance & Condemnation

### Frederick Douglass, "What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?" (1852)

> What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless... your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery.

**Source**: Frederick Douglass, speech delivered in Rochester, NY, July 5, 1852  
**Context**: Douglass's most famous speech challenged the hypocrisy of American liberty while millions remained enslaved. While not quoting the slur directly, Douglass addresses the dehumanization it represents.

### W.E.B. Du Bois, *The Souls of Black Folk* (1903)

All, nevertheless, flutter round it. They approach me in a half-hesitant sort of way, eye me curiously or compassionately, and then, instead of saying directly, How does it feel to be a problem? they say, I know an excellent colored man in my town.

**Source**: W.E.B. Du Bois, *The Souls of Black Folk*, Chapter 1: "Of Our Spiritual Strivings"  
**Context**: Du Bois articulates the experience of being defined by others' perceptions—the condition that racist language both creates and reinforces.

### Randall Kennedy, *Nigger* (2002)

### President Barack Obama, WTF Podcast (2015)

> It's not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public. That's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It's not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don't, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior.
