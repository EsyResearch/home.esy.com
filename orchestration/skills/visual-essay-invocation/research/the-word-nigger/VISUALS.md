# Visual Sources & Image Guidance

## ⚠️ Content Advisory

This document provides guidance for sourcing archival imagery for a documentary essay on a racial slur. Some source materials contain disturbing content. All imagery must be handled with extreme editorial care.

---

## Visual Sourcing Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Authenticity**: Use genuine historical photographs and documents only
2. **Never fabricate**: If an image must be illustrative, label it clearly
3. **Dignity**: Center the humanity of those targeted
4. **Balance**: Show resistance alongside oppression
5. **Context**: Every image requires caption explaining significance

### Critical Rule
> **Never generate or invent "historical" images.** All documentary visuals must come from verified archives. State uncertainty when it exists.

## Critical Handling: Lynching Imagery

### Policy on Lynching Photography

⚠️ **EXTREME CARE REQUIRED**

Lynching photographs and postcards exist as historical documents. Their inclusion requires:

1. **Minimized display**: Never full-screen, never large scale
2. **Critical framing**: Always with scholarly context
3. **Warning before display**: User must consent to view
4. **Dignity centered**: Focus on victims' humanity, not violence
5. **Resistance paired**: Show anti-lynching activism alongside

### Recommended Approach
- Reference existence of materials without displaying most graphic examples
- Use anti-lynching campaign materials instead where possible
- If shown, heavily contextualized and at reduced scale
- Link to scholarly resources (e.g., Equal Justice Initiative) rather than raw imagery

### Source with Care
**Collection**: *Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America*
**Warning**: Extremely disturbing content
**Use**: Reference for understanding scope; direct display rarely necessary
