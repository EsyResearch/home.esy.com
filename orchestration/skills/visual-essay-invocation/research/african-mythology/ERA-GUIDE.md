## Visual Arc Integration

### How Traditions Flow Together

```
ACT I (Wonder) → ACT V (Terror)

Yoruba (bright, royal)
    ↓
Akan (golden, clever)
    ↓
Fon (threshold, duality)
    ↓
Egyptian (judgment, descent)
    ↓
Zulu (creeping terror)
    ↓
Zanzibar (modern nightmare)
```

### Color Temperature Journey

| Act | Temperature | Saturation | Notes |
|-----|-------------|------------|-------|
| I | Warm (golden hour) | Full | Life, creation |
| II | Warm-neutral | Full | Order, structure |
| III | Mixed (dappled) | 80% | Uncertainty |
| IV | Cool-warm tension | 60% | Unease |
| V | Cool (blue hour to black) | 40% | Terror, drain |

### Transition Techniques

**Between traditions:**
- Geographic markers (maps, landscapes)
- Color palette shifts
- Typography changes
- Brief "travel" transitions

**Within traditions:**
- Consistent palette
- Unified animation language
- Coherent visual references

---

## Terror Chapter Special Treatment

The final act requires visual departure from all earlier traditions:

### Desaturation Protocol
- Begin terror chapters at 60% saturation
- Progress to 40% by chapter end
- Popobawa chapter: near-monochrome with single color accent

### Lighting Shift
- Eliminate warm tones
- Single light sources
- Deep shadows (no fill)
- High contrast

### Movement Change
- Slower, more deliberate

## Technical Specifications

### Image Processing by Tradition

| Tradition | Contrast | Grain | Vignette | Special |
|-----------|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| Yoruba | Medium | Low | Light | Brass highlight bloom |
| Akan | High | Low | None | Gold overlay effect |
| Fon | High | Medium | Medium | Serpent distortion |
| Egyptian | Medium | Medium | Heavy | Ancient texture overlay |

### Responsive Considerations

Each tradition's visual language must work on mobile:
- Color palettes must have sufficient contrast at small sizes
- Typography must remain readable
- Patterns must not become noise
- Terror effects must translate to small screens
