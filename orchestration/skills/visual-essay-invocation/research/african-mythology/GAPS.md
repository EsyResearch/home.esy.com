# Research Gaps and Cautions

> What we don't know, can't verify, or should approach carefully

---

## Overview

This document identifies limitations in the current research. Writers must avoid making claims beyond what research supports and must approach sensitive areas with appropriate caution.

---

## Verification Gaps

### Quotes Without Primary Sources

| Quote | Issue | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| "She who waits never tires..." (Ammit) | Thematic synthesis, not ancient text | Use as narrative voice, not direct quote |
| Some Anansi dialogue | Varies by version, no "canonical" text | Present as one version among many |
| Exact Eshu proverbs | Oral tradition variations | Note that variations exist |

### Figures With Limited Documentation

| Figure | Issue | Recommendation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Popobawa | Very recent (1960s+), limited academic study | Frame as modern/contemporary phenomenon |
| Adze | Limited primary ethnographic sources | Use secondary sources cautiously |
| Biloko | Central African forest traditions less documented | Keep description to well-attested details |

---

## Cultural Sensitivity Requirements

### Living Traditions

**Critical awareness:** These are NOT extinct belief systems. Millions practice traditions derived from these mythologies today:

| Tradition | Contemporary Practice | Caution |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Yoruba Orisha | Santería, Candomblé, Ifá, direct Yoruba practice | Active, global |
| Fon Vodun | Haitian Vodou, Louisiana Voodoo, direct practice | Active, often misrepresented |
| Akan traditions | Direct practice in Ghana | Active, integrated with daily life |
| Zulu beliefs | Direct practice in South Africa | Active |

**Implications:**
- Do not treat as "dead myths" or archaeology
- Avoid sensationalism of Vodun/Voodoo
- Respect that practitioners may read this essay
- Frame terror entities as cultural fears, not judgment on believers

### Imagery Considerations

| Category | Issue | Recommendation |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Deity images | May be sacred to practitioners | Use museum/historical sources, not contemporary sacred objects |
| Shrine photography | Living sacred spaces | Note permission/sensitivity requirements |
| Terror entities | Could reinforce stereotypes | Frame within cultural context, not as "primitive fears" |

## Claims to Avoid

### Overclaiming Connections

❌ **Don't claim:**
- All African traditions share common origins (many are independent)
- Egyptian mythology "influenced" sub-Saharan traditions (limited evidence)
- Direct lineage from ancient to modern practice (gaps exist)

✅ **Do claim:**
- Traditions are distinct but share some themes
- Egyptian mythology is African mythology (geographic fact)
- Contemporary practice is influenced by but not identical to historical forms

### Theological Precision

❌ **Don't claim:**
- Definitive interpretations of divine nature
- Single "correct" versions of myths
- Hierarchical rankings of deities across traditions

✅ **Do claim:**
- This version of the story...
- In this tradition, the figure represents...
- Among [specific people], it is said...

## Archaeological/Historical Gaps

### Uncertain Dating

| Topic | Issue |
|-------|-------|
| Origins of Yoruba Orisha system | Predates written records; estimates vary |
| Anansi story origins | Oral tradition; impossible to date precisely |
| Tokoloshe first accounts | Pre-literate; contemporary documentation from colonial era |

### Missing Documentation

| Topic | What's Missing |
|-------|---------------|
| Full Ifá corpus | Complete divination texts not fully translated/accessible |
| Regional variations | Many local versions of myths undocumented |
| Pre-colonial practice | Colonial-era documentation may distort original forms |

---

## Visual Gaps

### Imagery Not Readily Available

| Subject | Issue | Workaround |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Olodumare | Never depicted directly | Abstract/symbolic representation |
| Popobawa | Modern, no traditional iconography | Atmospheric/suggestive imagery |
| Some Zulu spirits | Limited museum documentation | Contemporary cultural documentation |

### Licensing Considerations

| Source Type | Potential Issue |
|-------------|-----------------|
| British Museum Benin Bronzes | Contested ownership, sensitive |
| Contemporary shrine photography | May require practitioner permission |
| Some African art photography | Varying rights situations |

---

## Narrative Gaps

### Stories With Missing Elements

| Story | What's Missing |
|-------|---------------|
| Anansi cycle | Hundreds of stories exist; can only feature a few |
| Zulu death origin | Multiple versions; which to use? |
| Eshu narratives | Vast corpus; selection is editorial |

### Connections Not Fully Researched

| Connection | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Diaspora connections (Vodou, Santería) | Mentioned but not developed |
| Islamic influence on some traditions | Not addressed |
| Christian syncretism | Not addressed |
| Inter-African cultural exchange | Not fully mapped |

---

## Expert Consultation Recommended

### Before Production

| Expert Type | Why Needed |
|-------------|------------|
| Yoruba cultural specialist | Verify Orisha details, contemporary practice |
| Egyptologist | Confirm hieratic translations, archaeological context |
| Southern African anthropologist | Verify Zulu/Xhosa tradition accuracy |
| West African art historian | Confirm visual source appropriateness |

### During Audit Phase

| Check | Specialist |
|-------|-----------|
| Cultural sensitivity review | African studies scholar |
| Living tradition verification | Practitioner consultant |
| Historical accuracy | Comparative mythology expert |

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Using well-documented museum sources
- Presenting myths as cultural narratives
- Acknowledging multiple versions exist

### Medium Risk
- Claims about "meaning" of symbols
- Direct quotes without primary sources
- Visual processing of sacred imagery

### High Risk
- Definitive theological claims
- Sensationalizing Vodun/terror entities
- Treating living traditions as dead history
- Using sacred imagery without context
