**Key Quote from Spain experience:**

## Notes for Production

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Orwell**: Most extensive visual coverage (5+ images across life phases)
2. **Stalin/Hitler**: 2-3 images each showing power and propaganda
3. **Yezhov**: The before/after erasure photos are ESSENTIAL
4. **Others**: 1-2 images each as supporting context

### Emotional Emphasis

- Orwell's journey should feel PERSONAL — trace the experiences that led to the novel
- Totalitarian leaders should feel REAL — these were actual people who murdered millions
- The human cost (gulag photos, ordinary citizens) grounds the abstraction

### Connections to Make

| Orwell Experience | *1984* Element |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Burma police | Understanding enforcers |
| Spanish War | Betrayal, truth falsification |
| BBC work | Ministry of Truth |
| NKVD in Spain | Thought Police |
| Stalin's purges | The Party's purges |
| Yezhov erasure | Memory holes, unpersoning |
