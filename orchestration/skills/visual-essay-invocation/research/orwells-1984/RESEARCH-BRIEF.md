## Research Constraints

### Time Period Focus

- **Primary**: 1903-1950 (Orwell's life)
- **Historical Context**: 1920s-1940s (rise of totalitarianism)
- **Legacy**: Brief treatment of post-1950 reception

### Geographic Focus

- **Britain**: Orwell's homeland, BBC
- **Burma/Myanmar**: Colonial police service
- **Spain**: Civil War, Barcelona

### Scope Boundaries

- Historical totalitarianism as CONTEXT for the novel, not independent study
- Novel's human elements (Winston, Julia) as essential, not optional
- Contemporary relevance should emerge organically, not be preachy
