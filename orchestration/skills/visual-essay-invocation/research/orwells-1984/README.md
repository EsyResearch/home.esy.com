## Enhanced Intake Document

### Topic

A comprehensive photorealistic exploration of George Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four* — examining the novel's prophetic warnings about totalitarianism, surveillance, truth manipulation, and the destruction of human spirit. The essay grounds the fiction in historical reality by connecting Oceania to the real-world regimes that inspired it (Stalinist USSR, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Francoist Spain), profiles the author whose personal experiences shaped every page, and centers the deeply human tragedy at the novel's core.

### Central Thesis

George Orwell didn't imagine *1984* — he synthesized it from horrors he witnessed firsthand. Every element of Oceania has a real-world origin: the Two Minutes Hate in Nazi rallies, the Ministry of Truth in his BBC propaganda work, the Thought Police in the NKVD and Gestapo. Understanding these connections transforms the novel from dystopian fiction into historical testimony.

### Target Audience

**Educated general readers and university students**
- Know of *1984* (Big Brother, thoughtcrime, doublethink) but may not have analyzed it deeply
- Want to understand WHY Orwell wrote this book and what demons drove him
- Should leave with concrete connections between Oceania and real 20th-century totalitarianism
- Emotional understanding of the novel's devastating human cost

### Visual Treatment

**Photorealistic Documentary Hybrid**

- **Author imagery**: George Orwell across all life phases (Burma, Spain, BBC, Jura)
- **Totalitarian leaders**: Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Franco — the real Big Brothers
- **Documentary imagery**: Soviet gulags, Nazi rallies, propaganda posters, surveillance
- **Spanish Civil War**: Documentary photography from ICP archives, Robert Capa collection
- **Human faces**: Prisoners, ordinary citizens under totalitarian rule
- **Modern resonance**: Subtle surveillance imagery (CCTV, facial recognition)
- **The "unpersoning"**: Famous Yezhov photograph series showing Stalin's erasure of history
- **Jura, Scotland**: Where Orwell wrote while dying
