## 1. NEW ORLEANS

### Overview
New Orleans stands as the birthplace of rhythm and blues, where African, Caribbean, and European musical traditions merged into a distinctive piano-driven sound. The city's unique cultural position as a port city and its strong African-American musical heritage created fertile ground for the development of R&B in the late 1940s.

## 2. MEMPHIS

### Overview
Memphis served as a critical crossroads where Delta blues met urban sophistication, producing two distinct but related sounds: the raw, electric blues of Sun Records in the 1950s and the smooth, horn-driven soul of Stax and Hi Records in the 1960s-70s.

### Key Studios

#### Sun Studio / Memphis Recording Service (1950-1959)
**Address:** 706 Union Avenue, Memphis, TN
**Years Active:** 1950-1959 (original operation); reopened 1987
**Founder/Engineer:** Sam Phillips

**Visual Description:**
A small storefront at the junction of Union and Marshall Avenues, near downtown Memphis. The studio occupied a modest brick building with a simple facade. Inside, the recording space was compact but functional, with basic acoustic treatment. The control room contained essential equipment including the Presto disc recorder and later, tape machines.

**Equipment:**
- Presto 8N disc recorder for cutting 16-inch lacquer discs
- Five-input Presto mixer board
- Presto PT900 portable tape recorder
- Later: Ampex tape machine

**Significance:**
Claims status as "the birthplace of rock & roll" based on Jackie Brenston's "Rocket 88" (1951). Today a National Historic Landmark.

**Notable Recordings:**
- "Rocket 88" - Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats (1951) - reputedly the first rock and roll single
- "Mystery Train" - Elvis Presley (1955)
- Early recordings by Howlin' Wolf, B.B. King, Rufus Thomas, Junior Parker

#### Phillips Recording Service (1960-1969)
**Address:** 639 Madison Avenue, Memphis, TN

**Founder:** Sam Phillips

Successor studio offering larger, more modern facilities.

---

#### Stax Recording Studios (1959-1975)
**Address:** 926 E. McLemore Avenue, Memphis, TN
**Years Active:** 1959-1975 (demolished 1989; museum replica opened 2003)
**Founders:** Jim Stewart, Estelle Axton

**Visual Description:**
The studio occupied a converted Capitol movie theater, which still retained the sloped floor where seats had once been. The cavernous room was partitioned with a control room created where the screen had been. The floor's slant - an accidental acoustic feature - helped deaden sound and became a signature part of the Stax sound. The theater's concession stand was converted into the Satellite Record Shop (later Stax record shop) in the front.

**Equipment:**
- Veteran Ampex mono recorder (late 1950s, still in use 1963)
- Two 4-channel Ampex mixers (model 3761)
- Ampex 350 mono recorder initially
- Scully model 280 for first stereo recordings (1965)
- Scully 4-track (1966/67)
- Custom Audiotronics console designed by Welton Jetton

**Key Recording Characteristics:**
- Musicians recorded without headphones in the main room
- Natural echo from the high-ceilinged former theater
- Singers stood behind heavy curtain behind drummer
- Delayed backbeat created by sound bouncing off ceiling
- "Hot" recording technique - saturating tape for harmonic distortion
- All recordings mono until 1965; no overdubs

**Significance:**
Soul music fans can often identify a Stax recording "within the first few notes" due to its distinctive deep, raw sound.

**Notable Recordings:**
- "Green Onions" - Booker T. & the M.G.'s (1962)
- "Soul Man" - Sam & Dave (1967)
- "Sittin' On The Dock of the Bay" - Otis Redding (1968)

**Visual Description:**
Originally constructed as the Shamrock Theater in 1915, converted into a recording studio in 1957. Producer Willie Mitchell described it as "nothing more than a remodeled nickelodeon." The sloped floor (like Stax's former theater) contributed to unique acoustics - "As you go down the slope, the music gets bigger, it separates."

### Key Venues

The Memphis club scene operated through venues on Beale Street and throughout the African-American community, providing a performance circuit for developing artists before they entered the studios.

---

### Sonic Contribution

**1. Sun Records Sound (1950s):**
- Raw, unpolished quality
- Slap-back echo effect
- Integration of blues, country, and gospel
- Foundation for rock and roll

**2. Stax/Memphis Soul Sound (1960s-70s):**
- Deep, raw yet warm tone
- Delayed backbeat rhythm
- Acoustic anomaly from sloped theater floor

### Economic Structure

- In-house session musicians (Booker T. & the M.G.'s at Stax; Hi Rhythm Section at Royal)
- Strong local distribution networks

Stax notably collapsed financially in 1975 due to distribution deal complications, demonstrating the vulnerability of this independent model.

## 3. DETROIT

### Overview
Detroit's Motown Records became the most successful Black-owned business in America by creating a sophisticated, crossover-ready sound that brought R&B to mainstream pop audiences. Berry Gordy's assembly-line approach to hit-making, modeled on the automobile factories where he once worked, produced a remarkably consistent and polished sound.

### Key Studios

#### Hitsville U.S.A. / Studio A (1959-1972)

**Visual Description:**
A two-family flat (formerly a photographer's studio) with an iconic "Hitsville U.S.A." sign visible from the street. Berry Gordy moved his family into the upper unit while converting the first floor into the label headquarters. Studio A, located in the basement, was nicknamed "the Snake Pit" due to the numerous microphone cords hanging from the ceiling and walls. The basement was cramped, smoke-stained, and dimly lit. The original wood floor was sometimes used as an instrument - singers would stomp their feet to the beat during recording sessions. Rickety wooden stairs led down to the recording space.

**Equipment:**

- "My Girl" - The Temptations
- "Stop! In the Name of Love" - The Supremes
- "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" - Marvin Gaye

## 4. CHICAGO

### Overview
Chicago transformed rural Delta blues into electrified urban R&B, creating the foundation for rock and roll. The city's South Side became a hub for Black migration from the Mississippi Delta, and local labels documented this transition from acoustic to electric blues.

**Visual Description:**
A modest two-story brick building originally constructed in 1911 for automobile parts sales and storage. In 1957, the Chess brothers converted the former auto repair shop into a recording studio. The building's industrial origins gave it a functional, utilitarian appearance - nothing fancy, but acoustically effective. The control room was compact but professionally equipped for the era.
