## Research Methodology Notes

### Source Hierarchy Used
1. Primary sources (autobiographies, contemporaneous interviews)
2. Academic sources (peer-reviewed, university press)
3. Institutional sources (museums, archives, libraries)
4. Reputable secondary sources (Billboard, Rolling Stone, NPR)
5. Documentary films (with verification)

### Verification Standard
- Minimum 2 independent sources for factual claims
- Primary source required for direct quotes
- Date verification through multiple timelines
- Figure identification through photo archives

---

## Recommendations for Essay

### Handle with Care
- Economic figures: Use ranges rather than exact numbers where uncertain
- Session musician credits: Acknowledge incompleteness of records
- Global influence: Focus on documented cases (UK, Japan) rather than claims

### Strengthen Through
- More oral history mining (Smithsonian, Rock Hall)
- Trade publication deep dives (Billboard, Cash Box archives)
- Estate documentation requests (for deceased artists)

### Accept Limitations
- Pre-1950 documentation is inherently sparse
- Session musician records were deliberately not kept
- Studio technical specs often undocumented
- Economic data was often proprietary/confidential
