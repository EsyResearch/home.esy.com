## Executive Summary

This research brief guides comprehensive source discovery for a photo-driven visual essay on R&B (Rhythm & Blues) — its origins, evolution, industry dynamics, and global spread. The essay must function as a documentary in prose: vivid scenes, strong pacing, grounded context, human stakes. Academically credible but emotionally alive.

## Primary Research Questions

These questions must be answered with verified, sourced evidence:

### 1. Origins and Naming
- Where did R&B begin — and what did the term originally mean?
- How did "Rhythm & Blues" emerge as a classification (replacing "race records")?
- Who coined or popularized the term, and when?
- What was the relationship between classification and market formation?

### 2. Musical Ancestry
- How did R&B evolve from Blues, Gospel, Jazz, and Pop — without losing its Black cultural core?
- What specific musical elements (backbeat, call-and-response, harmony stacks) came from which traditions?
- How did jump blues, boogie-woogie, and swing-era arrangements influence early R&B?

### 3. Geographic Networks
- Which cities/regions were critical, and why?
  - **New Orleans**: Piano traditions, groove, second-line rhythms
  - **Memphis**: Crossroads studios, Sun/Stax, distribution networks
  - **Detroit**: Motown factory model, Berry Gordy's system
  - **Chicago**: Amplification, Chess Records, electric blues
  - **Philadelphia**: Philly Sound, TSOP, lush orchestration
  - **New York/Harlem**: Vocal groups, Apollo Theater, publishing
  - **Los Angeles**: West Coast soul, studio innovations
  - **Atlanta**: Later era, hip-hop convergence
- What did each city contribute sonically AND economically?

### 4. Global Spread
- How did R&B become global — and what did it become once it traveled?
- Which international cities/scenes developed distinct R&B traditions?
- How did local conditions (language, censorship, industry, social politics) shape R&B in different countries?

### 5. Hip-Hop Relationship
- How did R&B intertwine with Hip-Hop (production, hooks, duet structures, radio formats)?
- When and how did rap features become standard in R&B?
- How did sampling and production techniques cross-pollinate?

### 6. Myths and Contested Narratives
What myths persist — and what does the evidence suggest instead?
- "R&B is just love songs" — evidence of political, social, community themes?
- "Crossover means selling out" — economic and cultural realities?
- "Technology ruined vocals/songwriting" — historical context?
- "Old R&B was pure / new R&B isn't real" — continuity evidence?
- "R&B died when [decade] ended" — evolution evidence?
- "The decline of songwriting" — craft and industry changes?

## Secondary Research Questions

### Industry and Economics
- How did the record business structure (majors, independents, subsidiaries) affect R&B?
- What role did payola, radio formats, and gatekeeping play?

### Labor and Craft
- Who were the key producers, songwriters, arrangers, session musicians, and engineers?
- How did studio teams (Motown, Stax, Philly International, etc.) operate?
- What was the role of vocal coaches, choreographers, and A&R?
- How did "the invisible triangle" (producer-songwriter-musician) function?

### Gender and Sexuality
- How did women function as architects (not appendices) of R&B?
- How was desire narrated across eras?
- How did artists navigate respectability, censorship, and freedom?
- What evidence exists for queer contributions to R&B?

### Technology as Destiny

## Hypotheses to Test

1. **Classification Theory**: The term "R&B" was as much a marketing/business category as a musical one — research should show industry documents proving this.

2. **Geographic Network Theory**: R&B's sound was shaped by specific studio ecosystems in specific cities — research should identify the distinct sonic contributions of each.

3. **Technology Periodization**: Major technological shifts (multitrack, drum machines, sampling, digital, streaming) correspond to genre style shifts — research should map these correlations.

4. **Gender Erasure Theory**: Women's contributions as architects (not just performers) have been systematically undervalued — research should surface the evidence.

5. **Crossover Politics**: "Crossover" was always about economics and race as much as music — research should find industry documents and artist statements proving this.

6. **Hip-Hop Symbiosis**: R&B and hip-hop co-evolved rather than hip-hop "taking over" R&B — research should show bidirectional influence evidence.
