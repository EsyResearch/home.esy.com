# Research Gaps: ROBOT — Grand Machina Edition

> What we couldn't fully verify or source

---

## Purpose

This document honestly records research gaps — areas where authoritative sources are lacking, claims that couldn't be verified, or topics requiring additional research. Writers should treat claims in these areas with appropriate hedging language.

---

## Gap Category 1: Primary Source Verification Needed

### Gap 1.1: Karel Čapek's Letter to OED (1933)
**Claim**: Čapek wrote to OED explaining Josef coined the word
**Status**: Widely cited but original letter not located
**Risk**: Medium — story is consistent across sources but primary document would strengthen
**Recommendation**: Use "according to Čapek's later account" framing

### Gap 1.2: Exact Premiere Date of R.U.R.
**Claim**: January 25, 1921 in Prague
**Status**: Some sources say 1920 (writing date) vs 1921 (premiere)
**Risk**: Low — minor date confusion
**Recommendation**: Distinguish "written 1920, premiered January 1921"

### Gap 1.3: Asimov Quote Variations
**Claim**: Various phrasings of Three Laws
**Status**: Different publications have slight variations
**Risk**: Low — use "Runaround" (1942) as canonical source
**Recommendation**: Quote from original story, not later retellings

---

## Gap Category 2: Incomplete Coverage

### Gap 2.1: Non-Western Robot Cultural History
**Claim**: Essay focuses primarily on Western + Japanese perspectives
**Status**: Limited research on Chinese, Korean, Indian robot culture
**Risk**: Medium — may miss important perspectives
**Recommendation**: Acknowledge Western/Japanese focus; note as limitation

### Gap 2.2: Soviet/Russian Robotics History
**Claim**: Essay covers mainly US/Europe/Japan
**Status**: Soviet robotics history exists but not included
**Risk**: Low — acceptable scope limitation
**Recommendation**: Not essential for word "robot" etymology focus

### Gap 2.3: Military Robotics
**Claim**: Essay excludes military/drone robotics
**Status**: Intentional scope choice, not research failure
**Risk**: Low — out of scope decision
**Recommendation**: Briefly note exclusion if relevant

---

## Gap Category 3: Rapidly Evolving Topics

### Gap 3.1: Current Humanoid Capabilities (2024-2025)
**Claim**: Boston Dynamics, Figure, Tesla capabilities
**Status**: Companies' claims change monthly; hard to verify
**Risk**: Medium — may be outdated by publication
**Recommendation**: Frame as "as of late 2024" or similar

### Gap 3.2: Sex Robot Industry Data
**Claim**: Market size, adoption rates
**Status**: Industry is opaque; hard to get reliable data
**Risk**: Medium — avoid specific numbers
**Recommendation**: Focus on ethical/research discussion, not market claims

### Gap 3.3: AI/Robot Relationship Legal Status
**Claim**: Legal frameworks for human-robot relationships
**Status**: Evolving rapidly; varies by jurisdiction
**Risk**: Medium — may change
**Recommendation**: Frame as "emerging" frameworks, avoid definitive statements

---

## Gap Category 4: Unverifiable Quotes

### Gap 4.1: Joseph Engelberger
**Quote**: "The key is to keep making robots more capable and less expensive"
**Status**: Widely attributed, primary source not located
**Risk**: Low — consistent with his known positions
**Recommendation**: Use "according to" or verify against biography

### Gap 4.2: Rodney Brooks on Roomba
**Quote**: "Not a robot that looks like a person... acts like a vacuum cleaner"
**Status**: Various phrasings in different interviews
**Risk**: Low — captures known philosophy
**Recommendation**: Paraphrase or find specific interview

### Gap 4.3: Hiroshi Ishiguro
**Quote**: "I want to understand what it means to be human"
**Status**: Widely quoted, various phrasings
**Risk**: Low — consistent theme in his work
**Recommendation**: Find specific interview for exact wording

---

## Gap Category 5: Imagery Availability

### Gap 5.1: Josef Čapek High-Quality Photos
**Status**: Limited high-resolution images
**Risk**: Low — public domain, can use what exists
**Recommendation**: May need to work with available lower-res

### Gap 5.2: Sex Robot/Companion Robot Imagery
**Status**: Ethical/legal concerns about specific product images
**Risk**: Medium — need tasteful, non-explicit imagery
**Recommendation**: Focus on research lab contexts, avoid commercial product shots

### Gap 5.3: David Levy Photo
**Status**: Limited public photos
**Risk**: Low — not essential figure
**Recommendation**: Could downgrade to Tier 3 or use book cover

## Claims to Avoid

Based on research gaps, avoid these unsupported claims:

1. ❌ Specific sex robot sales numbers
2. ❌ Predictions about when human-robot marriage will be legal
3. ❌ Claims about emotional equivalence between human-human and human-robot relationships
4. ❌ Specific capability claims about unreleased robots
5. ❌ Legal status assertions without jurisdiction specification

---

## Research Expansion Recommendations

If additional research time is available:

| Priority | Topic | Potential Sources |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| High | Čapek primary documents | Czech archives, OED historical records |
| Medium | Kate Devlin interview/quotes | Academic papers, conference talks |
| Medium | Current humanoid verification | Company press releases, demos |
| Low | Non-Western robot culture | Academic databases, regional sources |

## Writer Guidance

When encountering gap areas:

1. **Use hedging language**: "According to...", "Research suggests...", "As of 2024..."
2. **Avoid specific numbers**: For rapidly changing or opaque data
3. **Focus on patterns**: Not specific predictions
4. **Attribute clearly**: Especially for quotes without primary sources
5. **Acknowledge limitations**: If essay scope excludes important perspectives
