## Purpose of This Document

This document identifies claims that lack sufficient verification, topics with scholarly debate, and areas where the narrative should be careful about certainty. The invocation spec should **NOT** assert claims listed here as definitive fact.

---

## Tier 1 Gaps: Do Not Claim

These claims lack sufficient evidence or are actively disputed. **Do not include in the spec**.

### 1. Exact Etymology of 漢 Before Han River

**Issue**: The character 漢 predates the Han Dynasty, but its earliest pictographic meaning is unclear.

**What We Know**:
- The character appears in oracle bone script
- It was associated with the Han River
- The water radical (氵) suggests water-related meaning

**What We Don't Know**:
- The exact pictographic origin
- Whether it always referred to the Han River specifically
- Precise semantic evolution from Shang to Zhou periods

**Recommendation**: Say "associated with the Han River" rather than claiming definitive etymology

---

### 2. Wani's Historicity

**Issue**: Wani (王仁), credited with bringing Chinese writing to Japan, may be legendary.

**What We Know**:
- Japanese chronicles (*Kojiki*, *Nihon Shoki*) describe his mission
- Some Korean records also mention him
- Chinese writing did spread from Korea to Japan around the 4th-5th century

**What We Don't Know**:
- Whether Wani was a real individual or symbolic figure
- Exact dates and details of his mission
- His actual role vs. legendary attribution

**Recommendation**: Use qualifying language: "traditionally credited" or "according to legend"

---

### 3. Exact Pronunciation of Ancient "Han"

**Issue**: We cannot know exactly how 漢 was pronounced in ancient Chinese.

**What We Know**:
- Modern Mandarin: hàn
- Middle Chinese reconstructions suggest something like /ɣan/
- Variation existed across dialects and time periods

**What We Don't Know**:
- Exact pronunciation in Shang, Zhou, Qin, or Han periods
- How the word sounded when it reached Korea, Japan, Vietnam

**Recommendation**: Avoid claims about "how it sounded" in antiquity

---

## Tier 2 Gaps: Claim with Qualification

These topics have scholarly support but also debate. **Use qualifying language**.

### 4. Meaning of Korean 韓 (Han)

**Issue**: The meaning of the Korean Han (韓) is not definitively known.

**Scholarly Positions**:
- "Great" or "leader" — most commonly cited
- Connection to Mongolian "Khan" — some suggest, others dispute
- Simply a proper noun for the Samhan peoples — possible

**What We Know**:
- 韓 was used for the Samhan confederacies
- It was revived in 1897 for "Daehan Jeguk"
- It is etymologically distinct from Chinese 漢

**Recommendation**: Say "likely meant" or "scholars suggest" rather than definitive statements

---

### 5. Date of First Chinese Writing in Korea

**Issue**: The exact date when Chinese writing first reached Korea is uncertain.

**What We Know**:
- Archaeological evidence suggests contact by 3rd century BCE
- Han commanderies (108 BCE) accelerated spread
- Elite adoption was prominent by 4th century CE

**What We Don't Know**:
- Whether there was writing in Gojoseon before Chinese contact
- Exact timeline of character adoption among non-elites

**Recommendation**: Use date ranges rather than specific dates

---

### 6. King Sejong's Personal Views on Chinese Characters

**Issue**: While Sejong's preface to Hunminjeongeum is documented, his personal feelings about Chinese are interpreted.

**What We Know**:
- He stated Korean sounds differ from Chinese
- He wanted an accessible script for commoners
- He faced scholarly opposition

**What We Don't Know**:
- Whether he saw Hangul as a replacement for Hanja or a supplement
- His private views on Chinese cultural influence
- Exact political motivations beyond stated ones

**Recommendation**: Quote his documented statements; avoid psychological interpretation

---

### 7. Sun Yat-sen's Consistency on Han Identity

**Issue**: Sun Yat-sen's views on Han identity evolved over time.

**What We Know**:
- Early statements emphasized Han unity
- Later writings embraced multi-ethnic "Zhonghua minzu"
- He was politically pragmatic

**What We Don't Know**:
- Which statements represent his "true" beliefs
- How much was political calculation vs. personal conviction

**Recommendation**: Present his statements with dates; note evolution of thought

---

## Tier 3 Gaps: Minor Uncertainties

These are minor gaps that don't significantly affect the narrative. **Can work around**.

### 8. Exact Date of Liu Bang Becoming "King of Han"

**Issue**: Sources give slightly different dates for events in 206 BCE.

**Recommendation**: Use "206 BCE" as the dynasty founding; don't claim specific months

### 9. Precise Number of Han Characters in Each Script

**Issue**: Counts of Hanja, Kanji, Chữ Hán differ by source and definition.

**Recommendation**: Use qualitative descriptions ("thousands") rather than specific numbers

### 10. Typography Font History Details

**Issue**: Typeface history has some gaps, especially pre-modern periods.

**Recommendation**: General patterns are reliable; avoid very specific claims about origins

---

## Areas of Scholarly Debate

These topics have active scholarly disagreement. **Present multiple views or stay general**.

### 1. "Sinosphere" Concept

**Debate**: Some scholars question whether "Sinosphere" or "Han character cultural sphere" is a useful category, arguing it overstates cultural unity.

**Recommendation**: Use the term but acknowledge it's a scholarly construct

### 2. Han Chinese as Ethnic Category

**Debate**: Historians debate whether "Han Chinese" is a meaningful ethnic category or a modern political construction.

**Recommendation**: Present the constructionist view (Liang Qichao invented it) while acknowledging lived experience of Han identity

### 3. Vietnam's Script Transition

**Debate**: Scholars debate whether Quốc ngữ adoption was primarily colonial imposition or Vietnamese agency.

**Recommendation**: Present both factors; avoid oversimplification

---

## What NOT to Claim

Based on gaps analysis, the spec should **NOT**:

1. ❌ Claim we know the "original meaning" of 漢
2. ❌ Present Wani as historical fact without qualification
3. ❌ State exact ancient pronunciations
4. ❌ Define Korean 韓 meaning as definitively known
5. ❌ Attribute specific psychological motivations to historical figures
6. ❌ Present "Sinosphere" as uncontested concept
7. ❌ Oversimplify Vietnam's script transition

## Impact on Spec Construction

| Gap Area | Spec Approach |
|----------|---------------|
| Ancient etymology | Use "associated with" language |
| Legendary figures | "Traditionally credited" |
| Scholarly debate | "Scholars suggest" or present views |
| Specific dates | Use circa/approximate dates |
| Psychological claims | Quote documented statements only |

*Gaps documented. The invocation spec should avoid claims on these topics or use appropriate qualifying language.*
