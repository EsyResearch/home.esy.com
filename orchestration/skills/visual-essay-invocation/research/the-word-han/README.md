## Key Findings Summary

### The Two "Hans"

A critical discovery: There are **two distinct "Han" characters** with different origins:

1. **漢 (Chinese Han)**: Derives from the Han River (漢水) → Han Dynasty → Han Chinese ethnic identity → Han characters in writing systems (Hanja, Kanji, Hán tự)

2. **韓 (Korean Han)**: Derives from the ancient Samhan confederacies → possibly meaning "great" or "leader" → Korean national identity (Hanguk, Daehan)

These are **etymologically unrelated** despite phonetic similarity. This distinction is central to the narrative.

### Narrative Arc

1. **Origin**: A river in central China gives its name to a kingdom
2. **Empire**: Liu Bang's Han Dynasty becomes so foundational that "Han" = Chinese civilization
3. **Diffusion**: Han characters spread to Korea, Japan, Vietnam as script systems
4. **Recontextualization**: Korea uses a different "Han" (韓) for national identity
5. **Modernity**: "Han Chinese" becomes an ethnic category; geopolitical implications emerge

### Typography Significance

The essay prioritizes typography as narrative device:
- The character 漢 itself evolved through oracle bone → bronze → seal → clerical → regular script
- Regional typeface traditions (Ming/Song, Batang/Myeongjo, Minchō) share this heritage
- Modern pan-CJK fonts like Source Han Serif unite this visual tradition
