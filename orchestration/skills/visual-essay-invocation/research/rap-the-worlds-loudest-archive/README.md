## Project Overview

### "RAP: The World's Loudest Archive"

A **world-class, photo-driven, era-shifting visual essay** that traces the **entire history of RAP music** — from the prehistory of rhythmic speech and Black oral tradition to rap's birth as a recorded form, its regional revolutions, subgenre explosions, industry transformations, and global languages — **up to the present day**.

This is not a playlist. This is not a vibe piece. This is **history with teeth** — told with craft, precision, and storytelling heat.

## Core Mission

Create a **photo visual essay experience** — a museum exhibition that shape-shifts by decade. It must be:
- **Historically rigorous** (citations, dates, context)
- **Visually dense** (portraits, locations, artifacts)
- **Narratively propulsive** (scenes, turning points, human stakes)
- **Artistically designed** (typography, textures, layout rhythm that changes per era)
- **Comprehensive and exhaustive** in coverage of pivotal figures and key contributors

## Scope Parameters

### Research Questions to Answer

1. Where did rap come from — what existed before "rap" had a name?
2. How is rap connected to Hip-Hop culture, and how is it distinct as a musical form and industry?
3. Why was NYC foundational — and why did other regions become equally decisive?
4. How did rap become global — and what did it become in translation?
5. How did rap's sound evolve with technology (turntables → drum machines → samplers → DAWs → Auto-Tune → streaming)?
6. How did rap's themes evolve with politics and economics (deindustrialization, War on Drugs, policing, mass incarceration)?
7. What myths persist — and what does the evidence show instead?

### Coverage Targets (Mandatory)

| Metric | Minimum | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Named Contributors | 250 | 300+ |
| Portrait Gallery | 120 | 150+ |
| Timeline Entries | 80 | 120+ |
| Image/Artifact Plan | 200 | 350+ |
| Chapters | 14 | 18 |
| Design Skins | 10 | 12 |
| Glossary Terms | 60 | 100+ |
| Word Count | 8,000 | 15,000 |

### Era Coverage (Mandatory Balance)

Each decade MUST include:
- Multiple regions (not just NYC/LA/ATL)
- Women as architects, not footnotes
- Producers/engineers as core innovators
- Independent infrastructure (mixtapes, radio, clubs, internet)

## Visual Treatment

- **Medium**: Photorealistic (archival photography, documentary)
- **Hero**: Scroll-locked cinematic sequence
- **Era Skins**: 10-12 distinct visual treatments that morph with the music
- **Design Philosophy**: The page must FEEL the tonal shift from soft → glossy → militant → grim → surreal → global

### Required Design Skins

1. **Neon Playground** — Party Rap / early mainstream brightness
2. **TV Gloss** — Clean Pop-Rap / radio-friendly crossover
3. **Newsprint Urgency** — Conscious / political / street-reporter rap
4. **Boombox Brutalism** — Golden Age craft / lyrical architecture
5. **Casefile Noir** — Hardcore / gangsta / controversy era
6. **Chrome Heat** — Southern rap / club bass / regional independence
7. **Mixtape Xerox** — Mixtape economy / street distribution
8. **Luxury Minimal** — Art-rap / reinvention / high-fashion modernism
9. **Trap Architecture** — 808 modernity / producer-led sound design
10. **CCTV Frost** — Drill / cold minimalism / surveillance feeling
11. **Algorithm Glitch** — Internet / SoundCloud / meme micro-scenes
12. **Global Patchwork** — World rap networks / modular regional skins

## Chapter Structure (Planned)

### Prologue: "Before the Mic Was a Weapon"
African diasporic oral traditions, signifying, the dozens, toasts, Caribbean toasting, spoken word

### Main Chapters (14-18)
1. Rap Before Records — Oral prehistory

5. Golden Age — Lyrical craft as architecture
6. Conscious Rap — Rap as newspaper
7. Hardcore/Gangsta — Street reportage meets moral panic
8. Regional Breakouts — The map changes
9. 1990s-2000s Commerce — Celebrity and underground response
10. Producers Take the Wheel — Sound as story
11. Pop-Rap and Clean Rap — Soft power, TV power
12. Trap and the 808 Century
13. Melodic Rap — Emotion as flex
14. Drill — Cold sound, hot consequences
15. Internet Rap — Micro-scenes and chaos
16. Global Rap — Translation, power, local truth
17. Rap Now — The default pop language

### Epilogue: "The Last Bar Is a Door"

## Required Interludes (Cross-Cutting Threads)

1. **Women in Rap** — Integrated throughout; interlude ties the thread
2. **Queer Rap and Coded Spaces** — Where evidenced
3. **The Business of Rap** — Labels, distribution, publishing, touring
4. **Rap and the State** — Censorship, policing, court cases
5. **Fashion + Visual Identity** — Cover art, streetwear, luxury

## Special Requirements

### Ethics & Fact-Checking

- **No invented quotes, dates, "firsts," or fake attributions**
- If contested, present competing accounts and weigh evidence
- Handle violence, misogyny, exploitation as historical content to analyze — not aesthetic to glamorize
- Verify all "first-ever" claims with context
