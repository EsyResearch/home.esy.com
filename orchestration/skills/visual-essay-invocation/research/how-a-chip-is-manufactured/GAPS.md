# Research Gaps: How a Chip Is Manufactured

> Generated: December 15, 2025

This document identifies areas where research was limited, uncertain, or incomplete. Writers should NOT make claims in these areas without additional verification.

---

## Critical Gaps (Do Not Claim)

### 1. Exact Yield Percentages at Leading Edge

**Gap**: Specific yield numbers for TSMC 3nm, Intel 4, Samsung 3nm are proprietary and not publicly disclosed.

**What we have**: Industry estimates (50-80% for new nodes, improving over time)

**What we lack**: Confirmed figures from manufacturers

**Guidance**: Use ranges and qualifiers ("yields can be as low as 50%" or "industry estimates suggest")

---

### 2. Detailed Process Recipes

**Gap**: Exact temperatures, pressures, gas compositions, and timings for specific process steps are trade secrets.

**What we have**: General ranges and principles

**What we lack**: Specific recipes that would allow replication

**Guidance**: Focus on principles, not specifics. "Temperatures reaching 1000°C" rather than "exactly 1,050°C for 45 seconds"

---

### 3. Real-Time Equipment Pricing

**Gap**: Equipment costs vary by configuration, volume, and negotiated discounts.

**What we have**: Published list prices and estimates ($150-350M for EUV)

**What we lack**: Actual transaction prices, maintenance costs, full lifecycle costs

**Guidance**: Use approximate figures with qualifiers ("approximately" or "reportedly")

---

### 4. Company-Specific Process Differences

**Gap**: How TSMC's 3nm differs from Samsung's 3nm or Intel 4

**What we have**: General architectural differences (FinFET vs. GAA timelines)

**What we lack**: Detailed comparison of proprietary processes

**Guidance**: Avoid comparing companies' processes as equivalent or superior

---

## Moderate Gaps (Use Caution)

### 5. Historical First Claims

**Gap**: "First to achieve X" claims are often disputed

**What we have**: Approximate timelines for technology introduction

**What we lack**: Definitive attribution for all innovations

**Guidance**: Use "among the first" or "pioneered" rather than absolute claims

---

### 6. Future Roadmap Details

**Gap**: What comes after 2nm is speculative

**What we have**: Announced intentions from major companies

**What we lack**: Certainty that roadmaps will be achieved

**Guidance**: This essay is about current process, not future. Avoid speculation.

---

### 7. Exact Transistor Dimensions

**Gap**: "3nm node" doesn't mean 3nm transistors — actual dimensions vary

**What we have**: Industry estimates of actual gate lengths (~12nm for "3nm" node)

**What we lack**: Official confirmation from manufacturers (marketing vs. physics)

**Guidance**: Explicitly note that node names are marketing terms, not measurements

---

### 8. Cleanroom Particle Counts

**Gap**: Real-world cleanroom performance vs. specification

**What we have**: ISO classifications and target particle counts

**What we lack**: Actual achieved particle counts in production fabs

**Guidance**: Use specifications, acknowledge these are targets

---

## Minor Gaps (Acceptable Simplification)

### 9. Regional Variations in Process

**Gap**: Processes may vary by fab location, even within same company

**What we have**: General industry-standard processes

**What we lack**: Site-specific variations

**Guidance**: Describe generic process; acceptable simplification for audience

---

### 10. Full Supply Chain Complexity

**Gap**: Thousands of suppliers, materials, and intermediaries not covered

**What we have**: Main process flow and key equipment

**What we lack**: Complete supplier ecosystem

**Guidance**: Focus on main process; acknowledge complexity exists beyond scope

---

### 11. Environmental and Safety Details

**Gap**: Specific chemical hazards, waste streams, energy consumption

**What we have**: General awareness that fabs use hazardous materials and significant energy

**What we lack**: Detailed environmental impact data

**Guidance**: Not in scope for this essay; do not make environmental claims

---

## Areas Explicitly Out of Scope

The following are intentionally not covered (per intake requirements):

1. **Chip design process** — Essay covers manufacturing only
2. **Software/firmware** — Hardware manufacturing focus
3. **History of semiconductors** — Process-focused, not historical narrative
4. **Biographical profiles** — Process-focused, minimal personality content
5. **Future technology predictions** — Current process, not futurism
6. **Company rankings or comparisons** — Neutral industry overview
7. **Investment/stock analysis** — Technical focus, not financial

---

## Claims That Should NOT Be Made

Based on research gaps, the following claims should be avoided:

| Claim Type | Example | Why Problematic |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| Absolute yield | "TSMC achieves 85% yield" | Proprietary, unverifiable |
| Superlatives | "The most advanced fab" | Subjective, changes rapidly |
| Exact costs | "Costs exactly $X per wafer" | Varies, proprietary |
| Company superiority | "TSMC is better than Samsung" | Beyond scope, subjective |
| Future certainty | "2nm will arrive in 2025" | Speculative |
| First/inventor claims | "X invented Y" | Often disputed |

---

## Recommended Hedging Language

When discussing uncertain areas, use:

- "Industry estimates suggest..."
- "Approximately..."
- "Reportedly..."
- "On the order of..."
- "Can range from X to Y..."
- "Typically..."
- "In general..."

---

## Additional Research Recommendations

If the essay requires greater specificity, these sources could help:

1. **Yield data**: Semiconductor industry analyst reports (IC Insights, Yole, TechInsights) — paywalled
2. **Process details**: Equipment vendor technical papers (Applied Materials, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron)
3. **Cost data**: Industry conferences (IEDM, VLSI Symposium) proceedings
4. **Company specifics**: Earnings calls, investor presentations (use cautiously — marketing bias)

---

## Gap Acknowledgment for Readers

The visual essay should acknowledge its scope:

> "This essay explains the general semiconductor manufacturing process. Specific processes vary by company, node, and application. Technical details are simplified for accessibility while maintaining accuracy on fundamental principles."

---

## Summary

**What this research supports**: General semiconductor manufacturing process, principles, approximate scale, economic context, geopolitical significance.

**What this research does NOT support**: Specific yield numbers, exact costs, company comparisons, process recipes, future predictions.

Writers should stay within the supported claims and use appropriate hedging for areas of uncertainty.
