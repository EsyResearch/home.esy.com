## Research Summary

This package supports a process-focused visual essay explaining semiconductor manufacturing from sand to finished chip. Unlike personality-driven visual essays, this research centers on **processes** rather than **people**.

### Key Findings

1. **Purity is Paramount**: Electronic-grade silicon requires 99.9999999% (9N) purity — less than one foreign atom per billion
2. **Scale is Staggering**: Modern transistors (3nm node) have gate lengths smaller than many viruses
3. **Yield is Economics**: Most chips fail; advanced node yields around 70-80% at best
4. **Complexity is Barrier**: 1000+ process steps, $20B+ fab cost creates insurmountable entry barriers
5. **Geopolitics is Real**: Chip manufacturing concentration is a national security concern globally

### Research Limitations

- Exact yield percentages at leading edge are proprietary (estimates used)
- ASML EUV pricing varies by configuration
- Specific process recipes are trade secrets
- Some technical details simplified for audience comprehension

## Usage Notes

Writers should reference this package for:
- All technical claims (verify against TECHNICAL-DATA.md)
- Scale comparisons (use approved comparisons from SCALE-COMPARISONS.md)
- Process descriptions (follow PROCESS-PROFILES.md sequence)
- Citations (all sources in CITATIONS.md)

**Do not fabricate additional technical claims not supported by this package.**
