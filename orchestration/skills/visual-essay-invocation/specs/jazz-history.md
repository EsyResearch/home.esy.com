# Visual Essay Invocation: JAZZ — The Sound of Freedom in Real Time

**Subtitle**: A deeply researched, photo-driven visual essay tracing the roots, origins, and evolution of America's original art form

---

## Layer 1: Strategic Foundation

### Project Title
**JAZZ: The Sound of Freedom in Real Time**

*A visual essay tracing how African diasporic traditions, European instruments, and the unique conditions of New Orleans produced America's most influential art form—and how it spread across the world as both music and cultural force.*

### Executive Brief

**Emotional Throughline**: From the mystery of a single photograph to the stages of Lincoln Center, this is the story of how an art form born in the collision of cultures became the sound of freedom—improvised, dangerous, virtuosic, and unstoppable.

**Stakes**: Jazz is the foundational grammar of American popular music. To understand jazz is to understand how Black American innovation shaped global culture despite—and because of—the constraints of segregation, economic exploitation, and cultural erasure.

**Transformation Promise**: The reader begins seeing jazz as "old music" and ends understanding it as a living philosophy—improvisation as worldview, call-and-response as conversation, the blues as truth-telling.

**Central Question**: How did a music born in the margins become the defining art form of the American century?

### Visual Treatment Philosophy

**Primary Mode**: Photorealistic (archival photography)

**Source Priority**:
1. Library of Congress Gottlieb Collection (1938-1948) — public domain, primary source
2. Hogan Jazz Archive (Tulane) — New Orleans specialty
3. Smithsonian National Museum of American History
4. Carl Van Vechten Collection (Library of Congress) — public domain

**Era Processing**:
| Era | Treatment |
|-----|-----------|
| Pre-1900 | Sepia, aged paper texture |
| 1900-1920 | High contrast B&W, formal |
| 1920s | Warm B&W, Art Deco vignettes |
| 1930s-1945 | Sharp studio B&W, Gottlieb aesthetic |
| 1945-1955 | Noir B&W, dramatic shadows |
| 1955-1965 | Cool tones, Blue Note aesthetic |
| 1965-1980 | Saturated color, psychedelic |
| 1980-present | Contemporary color |

**Photo Rules**:
- No illustrations mixed with photography
- Parallax achieved through photo masking/separation
- Era-appropriate grain and contrast
- All images must have verified archive sources

## Layer 2: Technical Systems

### Scroll-Lock Specification

**Lock Behavior**: Viewport locks during key narrative moments; scroll input drives animation progress

**Lock Zones**:
- Hero: 2000px scroll depth (major cinematic sequence)
- Chapter openers: 800px scroll depth
- Key moment sequences: 1200px scroll depth
- Figure spotlights: 600px scroll depth

**Skip Affordance**: Always visible; "Continue ↓" indicator after 3 seconds of inactivity

**Smooth Transitions**:
- Lock engage: 400ms ease-out
- Lock release: 300ms ease-in
- Content transitions within lock: 600ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)

### Parallax Depth System

| Layer | Content | Speed Ratio | z-index |
|-------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Background | Era texture, atmospheric | 0.2 | 0 |
| Mid | Secondary figures, venue shots | 0.5 | 10 |
| Subject | Primary figure, focal image | 1.0 | 20 |
| Overlay | Quotes, year markers | 1.2 | 30 |
| Ambient | Smoke, light particles, musical notation | 0.3 | 5 |

### Themed Progress Indicator

**Concept**: Musical Staff with Notes

The progress bar is a musical staff (5 lines). As the reader scrolls, notes appear on the staff, building a melodic phrase. Each chapter adds notes until the final resolution chord.

**Behavior**:
- Empty staff at 0%
- Notes accumulate corresponding to chapter progress
- Chapters marked by measure bars
- Final chord (full harmony) at 100%

**Visual Style**:
- Off-white staff lines on dark background
- Notes in era-appropriate style (early chapters: whole notes; bebop: 16th notes; free jazz: clusters)
- Subtle glow on current note

## Layer 3: Hero Architecture

### Hero Sequence: "The Only Photograph"

**Concept**: Open with the mystery of Buddy Bolden—the man who invented jazz but left only one photograph and no recordings.

**Scroll-Lock Choreography** (2000px depth):

| Progress | Visual State | Text/Audio |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| 0-15% | Black screen, single spotlight circle | "There is only one photograph." |
| 15-30% | Bolden band photo fades in, heavily vignetted | "Buddy Bolden. 1905. New Orleans." |
| 30-45% | Slow zoom into Bolden's face | "They called him King. He invented a sound." |
| 45-60% | Photo degrades, becomes grainy, ghostly | "No one recorded it. No one wrote it down." |
| 60-75% | Photo fragments into particles | "And then he was gone—committed to an asylum at 30, dead at 54." |
| 75-90% | Particles swirl, reform into musical notation | "But the sound didn't die. It multiplied." |
| 90-100% | Title card emerges: "JAZZ" | Full title + subtitle reveal |

**Title Reveal Pattern**: Mystery → Absence → Legacy → Title

**Music Cue**: (If audio implemented) Start with silence, introduce low brass note at 30%, build to full New Orleans brass at 90%

| Content transitions | 600ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) |
| Photo parallax | Varies by layer (0.2-1.2) |
| Text reveal | 400ms stagger, 100ms per line |
| Quote entrance | 800ms fade-in with subtle rise |

### Parallax Speed Ratios

| Layer | Ratio | Example Content |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Background | 0.2 | Era texture, smoke |
| Mid | 0.5 | Secondary figures, venues |

## Layer 6: Implementation

### Responsive Adaptations

**Desktop (1200px+)**:
- Full parallax depth system
- Side-by-side figure comparisons
- Large quote treatments
- Full scroll-lock experiences

**Tablet (768-1199px)**:
- Reduced parallax layers (3 vs. 5)
- Stacked layouts
- Maintained scroll-lock depth

**Mobile (< 768px)**:
- Single-layer parallax (subject only)
- Full-bleed images
- Simplified scroll-locks (shorter depth)
- Touch-optimized skip affordances
- Portrait-optimized figure profiles

### Accessibility Requirements

1. **Reduced Motion**: Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`
   - Replace parallax with static positioning
   - Replace scroll-lock with standard scroll
   - Maintain content, remove animation

2. **Skip Controls**: Always visible after 3 seconds
   - "Skip to content" for hero
   - "Continue ↓" for all locked sections

3. **Alt Text**: Every photograph described
   - Include era, subject, source archive
   - Example: "Charlie Parker playing alto saxophone, close-up portrait, 1947. William P. Gottlieb Collection, Library of Congress."

4. **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 for body text)

5. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full support for scroll-locks

### Source Attribution Standards

**In-Content Citations**:
- Photographer credit where known
- Archive source for all images
- Publication source for all quotes

**Sources Section**:
- Organized by tier (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)
- Full bibliographic information
- Active links verified

**Image Credits**:
- Public domain noted where applicable
- License type for all images
- Archive contact for permission-required images
