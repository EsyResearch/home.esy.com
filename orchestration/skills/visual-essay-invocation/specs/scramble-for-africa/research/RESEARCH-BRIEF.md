## Primary Research Questions

### The Why: European Motivations
1. What economic forces drove the sudden acceleration of African colonization after 1870?
2. How did nationalist competition and prestige politics fuel the scramble?
3. What role did technological innovations (quinine, steamships, Maxim gun) play in enabling conquest?
4. How did Social Darwinism and the "civilizing mission" ideology justify colonization?

### The How: Mechanisms of Partition
5. What principles did the Berlin Conference (1884–85) establish for dividing Africa?
6. How did European powers use treaties, charters, and concession companies to legitimize claims?
7. What was the role of explorers and missionaries as advance agents of colonization?
8. How did different colonial powers structure their administrations (direct vs. indirect rule)?

### African Agency: Resistance and Adaptation
9. What strategies did African leaders employ to resist or adapt to European encroachment?
10. Why did Ethiopia succeed at Adwa where others failed?
11. How did African diplomatic efforts attempt to exploit European rivalries?
12. What internal factors (division, technology gaps, prior disruption from slave trade) hampered defense?

### The Impact: Systems and Legacies
13. How did colonial borders fragment ethnic groups and create artificial states?
14. What economic systems (forced labor, concessions, cash crops) did colonizers impose?
15. How did the scramble reshape power structures within Africa and Europe?
16. What continuities connect colonial-era decisions to modern African conflicts and economies?

## Secondary/Exploratory Questions

### European Domestic Politics
- How did domestic political pressures in France, Germany, and Britain push leaders toward colonial expansion?
- What was the relationship between railroad investment booms and the scramble?

### Comparative Colonial Systems
- How did French "assimilation" differ from British "indirect rule" in practice?
- Why was the Congo Free State uniquely brutal compared to other colonies?
- How did German colonial administration differ (e.g., Herero genocide)?

### The Congo Case Study
- What was the rubber quota system and how did it function?
- How did E.D. Morel and Roger Casement expose Congo atrocities?
- What was the international response and how did it affect Leopold's rule?

### Pre-WWI Tensions
- How did colonial rivalries contribute to the alliance systems that caused WWI?
- What happened to German colonies after WWI (mandates)?

## Hypotheses to Test

1. **Economic determinism**: The scramble was primarily driven by economic interests (raw materials, markets, investment opportunities) rather than strategic or ideological factors.

2. **Fragmented defense**: Africa's inability to mount unified resistance stemmed from the prior destabilization caused by centuries of slave trade and internal divisions.

3. **Paper partition**: Much of Africa was "claimed" before it was actually "controlled"—the Berlin Conference created legal fictions that took decades to become realities on the ground.

4. **Selective resistance success**: Ethiopian victory at Adwa was exceptional due to specific factors (modernized army, terrain, European underestimation) that were not replicable elsewhere.

5. **Colonial continuity**: Post-independence African states inherited colonial borders, economic structures, and administrative systems that continue to shape their challenges today.
