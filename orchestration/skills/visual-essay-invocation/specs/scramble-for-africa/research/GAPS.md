# Research Gaps: The Scramble for Africa

> **Purpose**: Document what could NOT be verified or found  
> **Usage**: Spec and production should AVOID claims in these areas

---

## Documented Gaps

### Gap 1: Precise Death Toll Numbers
**Area**: Casualty figures for colonial atrocities

**Issue**: 
- Leopold's Congo death toll (10 million) is widely cited but contested
- Pre-colonial population data is unreliable
- Some historians argue for higher or lower figures
- Herero/Nama figures also have ranges

**Recommendation**:
- Use Hochschild's 10 million for Congo with "estimated" qualifier
- Use "approximately" or ranges for all casualty figures
- Acknowledge historiographical debate exists

**Do NOT claim**: Exact, precise death tolls as established fact

---

### Gap 2: Some African Leaders' Direct Quotes
**Area**: Verified quotes from African resistance leaders

**Issue**:
- Samori Ture, Lobengula, Empress Taytu quotes are "attributed" not verified
- Oral tradition rather than written records
- Colonial sources may have distorted African statements
- Limited primary documentation in African languages

**Recommendation**:
- Use "attributed to" or "reportedly said" for unverified quotes
- Prioritize quotes with documented sources (Menelik's diplomatic correspondence, Cetshwayo's recorded testimony)
- Note the documentary asymmetry (European sources dominate)

**Do NOT claim**: Exact wording for quotes marked ⚠️ in QUOTES.md

---

### Gap 3: Pre-Colonial African Economic Data
**Area**: Quantitative data on African economies before colonization

**Issue**:
- Limited quantitative records for pre-colonial African states
- Population figures are estimates
- Trade volumes are approximations
- Difficult to quantify "what was lost"

**Recommendation**:
- Use qualitative descriptions of pre-colonial sophistication
- Reference established kingdoms and trade networks
- Avoid specific economic statistics for pre-1870 period

**Do NOT claim**: Specific GDP, population, or trade figures for pre-colonial Africa

---

### Gap 4: Photographs of Some Key Figures
**Area**: Visual documentation for African leaders

**Issue**:
- Limited photography of some African leaders (see VISUALS.md gaps)
- Muhammad Ahmad (Mahdi) has no photographs (religious tradition)
- Samori Ture has limited imagery
- Pre-1880 figures have engravings, not photos

**Recommendation**:
- Use available photographs where they exist
- Use period illustrations/engravings with acknowledgment
- For Mahdi, use artistic/symbolic representation

**Do NOT claim**: Photographs exist for all key figures

---

### Gap 5: Internal African Political Dynamics
**Area**: Detailed understanding of African state politics

**Issue**:
- Research focused more on European-African interaction
- Internal African politics before colonization less documented
- Power struggles within African states during colonization period
- Limited access to African-language primary sources

**Recommendation**:
- Focus on documented resistance and diplomatic efforts
- Acknowledge complexity exists beyond what we can detail
- Use UNESCO *General History* for African-centered perspective

**Do NOT claim**: Comprehensive understanding of internal African politics

---

### Gap 6: Leopold's Personal Statements
**Area**: Direct quotes from Leopold about his true intentions

**Issue**:
- "Magnificent African cake" quote is widely attributed but not verified against primary source
- Leopold was careful about what he wrote/said publicly
- Private correspondence may be inaccessible or lost

**Recommendation**:
- Use "attributed to" for the cake quote
- Focus on documented actions rather than private statements
- Morel and Casement documented the results, not Leopold's words

**Do NOT claim**: Leopold explicitly stated genocidal intentions in verified documents

---

### Gap 7: Detailed Comparative Colonial Economics
**Area**: Precise economic comparison between colonial systems

**Issue**:
- Different record-keeping across empires
- Currency and accounting variations
- Profit extraction vs. reinvestment data incomplete
- Long-term economic impact attribution complex

**Recommendation**:
- Use qualitative comparisons (more/less exploitative)
- Focus on documented practices (forced labor, rubber quotas)
- Avoid precise profit/loss figures without strong sources

**Do NOT claim**: Precise economic statistics comparing colonial systems

---

### Gap 8: African Oral Histories
**Area**: Comprehensive African oral tradition perspectives

**Issue**:
- Oral histories not systematically collected until later
- Colonial-era sources primarily European perspective
- Language barriers limit primary source access
- Much may have been lost

**Recommendation**:
- Acknowledge documentary bias toward European sources
- Use available African-perspective scholarship (Marcus, Boahen)
- Explicitly note whose voices are and aren't heard

**Do NOT claim**: Full representation of African perspectives

---

## Areas of Historiographical Debate

### Debate 1: Economic vs. Strategic Motives
**Issue**: Historians disagree on relative weight of economic drivers vs. strategic competition

**Recommendation**: Present both as contributing factors without definitive ranking

### Debate 2: "New Imperialism" Distinctiveness
**Issue**: Whether post-1870 colonialism was qualitatively different from earlier imperialism

**Recommendation**: Focus on what happened rather than historiographical categorization

### Debate 3: African "Failure" to Resist
**Issue**: Whether framing should emphasize African defeat or resistance

**Recommendation**: Emphasize widespread resistance + structural factors explaining outcomes

### Debate 4: Colonial Modernity
**Issue**: Whether colonialism brought any "positive" developments (infrastructure, education)

**Recommendation**: Acknowledge infrastructure existed but was extractive; avoid "benefits of colonialism" framing

## Usage Instructions for Production

1. **Spec Construction**: Do not include claims from Gap areas
2. **Writing**: Use hedging language for attributed content
3. **Fact-Checking**: Re-verify any claim that touches Gap areas
4. **Visual Treatment**: Use available imagery; acknowledge limitations
5. **Narrative**: Structure around well-documented events and figures

*Gaps documented for production integrity. All claims in spec should trace to verified sources.*
