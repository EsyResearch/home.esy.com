# Visual Essay Invocation: Phonē — From Voice to Device

---

## Layer 1: Strategic Foundation

### Project Title
**"Phonē: From Voice to Device"**

### Executive Brief

Create a typography-driven, scroll-animated visual essay that traces the Greek word φωνή (phonē, "voice/sound") across 2,800 years — from its first appearance in Homer's epics, through Aristotle's philosophical definition of voice as "sound significant by convention," into the 19th century's explosive coinage of compound words (telephone, phonograph, microphone, saxophone), through Bell's patent that made *telephone* the word of the century, to its rapid clipping into *phone* (1878), and finally to the smartphone era where a word meaning "voice" now names a device rarely used for voice at all.

This is an etymology essay. The word itself is the protagonist. Every visual decision serves the word's journey.

**Why this matters now:** Every person reading this essay is carrying a "phone" — a device named after the ancient Greek word for voice. They use it for photos, messaging, browsing, maps, and payments. They almost never use it for its namesake function: voice. The word has outlived its meaning. This essay reveals the hidden biography inside the most ubiquitous noun of the 21st century.

**Emotional transformation:** Curiosity → recognition → wonder at linguistic mechanics → awe at the compound explosion → intimacy with Bell's story → delight at the clipping → dissonance at the modern paradox → the word will never sound the same again.

### Visual Treatment Philosophy

#### Typography-Led, Photography-Supported Treatment (Hybrid Minimalist + Archival)

This essay is **typography-led** — the word itself is the protagonist and primary visual hero. But the word's journey is richly supported by **extensive archival photography** that grounds each era in physical reality. The reader sees both the word and the world it moved through.

**Primary visual layer (typography):**
1. **Greek characters rendered as art**: φωνή displayed at display scale, with attention to its visual beauty
2. **Morphological anatomy diagrams**: Interactive breakdowns of compound words (τῆλε|φωνή, μικρό|φωνή) with color-coded roots
3. **Word family tree**: A branching SVG visualization showing all descendants of φωνή
4. **The word transforming**: Scroll-driven letter morphing from φωνή → phonē → -phone → telephone → phone → 📱

**Supporting visual layer (archival photography, 20–28 images):**
5. **Ancient Greek era**: Inscribed pottery, papyrus fragments, Greek theater ruins, Aristotle-era manuscript reproductions
6. **19th-century inventions**: Reis's 1861 Telephon device, Wheatstone's acoustic instruments, Sax's original saxophone, patent drawings
7. **The Bell Moment**: Alexander Graham Bell (extensively photographed), the original US Patent 174,465 drawing, Bell's laboratory, early telephone prototypes, the first telephone exchange
8. **Edison era**: Edison with the phonograph, the original phonograph device, laboratory photographs
9. **The phone evolves**: Candlestick telephones, rotary dial phones, phone booths (1920s–1970s), phone operators at switchboards, phone books
10. **Modern era**: Touch-tone phones, early cell phones (brick phones), BlackBerry, iPhone launch (2007), modern smartphone in hand

**Visual philosophy**: Typography carries the etymological argument. Photography carries the emotional weight — making the reader *feel* each era the word passed through. The two layers work in counterpoint: the word is abstract; the photos make it concrete.

**Color derives from writing and transmission materials across eras:**
- Ink black and papyrus cream (Greek manuscript)
- Sepia and vellum (Latin bridge)
- Iron-gall ink and technical-drawing blue (19th century)
- Copper and telegraph amber (Bell era)
- Glass blue and aluminum silver (smartphone era)

## Layer 2: Technical Systems

### Scroll-Lock Animation System

**Required Behavior:**
- Scroll into designated zone triggers viewport lock
- Continued scroll input controls animation progress
- Visual progress indicator shows sequence completion
- Upon 100% completion, lock releases with smooth easing
- Skip affordance: "Skip to continue" link, bottom-right, 40% opacity until hover

**Scroll-Lock Sequences for This Essay:**

1. **The Word Appears** (Hero) — From a dark viewport, the Greek letters φ, ω, ν, ή materialize one by one, as if being written by an ancient hand. Each letter animates with calligraphic stroke order. Below, the transliteration *phonē* fades in, then the translation: *"voice. sound. utterance."* Duration: 2–3 scroll-screens.

2. **The Compound Builder** (Section 3) — An interactive morphological breakdown. The root φωνή sits at center. Scroll reveals prefixes approaching from the left: τῆλε- (tele-, "far") slides in and docks → τηλέφωνη / telephone. Continue scrolling: μικρό- (micro-, "small") replaces tele- → microphone. Then φωνο- + γραφή (graphē, "writing") → phonograph. 6–8 compounds animate in sequence, each splitting apart and reassembling. Duration: 4 scroll-screens.

3. **The Family Tree** (Section 3/4 transition) — The word family tree (from WORD-FAMILY.md) animates as a growing branching structure. Starting from the PIE root *bʰeh₂- at the trunk, branches extend: one toward Greek φημί (→ fame, fate, fable), another toward φωνή. The φωνή branch then explodes into 30+ descendants, each appearing at its attested date. The reader scrolls "upward through time." Duration: 5 scroll-screens.

4. **The Great Truncation** (Section 5) — The word TELEPHONE is displayed at full width. As the reader scrolls, the letters T-E-L-E fade and drift away, leaving just PHONE. An apostrophe appears briefly ('PHONE) then also fades. The word shrinks from 9 letters to 5. Then compound-building begins from the clipped form: PHONE BOOTH, PHONE BOOK, CELL PHONE, SMARTPHONE scroll-build from the base word. Duration: 3 scroll-screens.

5. **The Paradox** (Section 6) — The word PHONE sits centered. Around it, icons of its modern functions orbit: 📷 camera, 💬 messaging, 🗺️ maps, 💳 payments, 🌐 browsing. The voice/call icon (📞) is smallest and faintest. Scroll makes the icons orbit faster, the voice icon dimmer. The Greek φωνή ghosts behind the modern PHONE — the ancient voice fading inside the modern device. Duration: 2 scroll-screens.

### Parallax Depth System

- **Layer 0 (Background):** Subtle parchment/paper texture — moves at 0.2× scroll
- **Layer 1 (Mid-ground):** Faded etymological annotations, timeline dates — moves at 0.5× scroll
- **Layer 2 (Subject):** Primary typography, word displays, diagrams — moves at 1.0× (reference)
- **Layer 3 (Overlay):** Translations, definitions, source attributions — moves at 1.2× scroll

### Progress Bar Design

#### Concept: "The Derivation Chain"

The progress indicator is a vertical strip along the left edge displaying the word's current form at each section:

- 0–15%: **φωνή** (Greek characters, ink black)
- 15–30%: **phonē** (transliterated, sepia)
- 30–50%: **-phone** (combining form, technical blue)
- 50–65%: **telephone** (full compound, copper)
- 65–80%: **phone** (clipped, modern black)
- 80–100%: **📱** (emoji/icon, glass blue)

The word literally transforms as the reader progresses — a miniature version of the essay's journey.

### Three Voices Narration System

| Voice | Purpose | Typography | Usage |
|-------|---------|------------|-------|
| **Etymologist** | Derivations, linguistic analysis, word histories | Clean serif (body text) | Primary narrative 55% |
| **Source** | Quotes, primary texts, dictionary entries | Italic serif, slightly smaller | Pull quotes, citations 25% |
| **Insight** | Contemporary observations, the "so what" moments | Sans-serif, subtle weight | Contextual commentary 20% |

## Layer 3: Hero Architecture

### Hero Section: "The Voice"

**Visual**: Full-viewport darkness — the color of unwritten papyrus before ink. Silence. Then, as the reader scrolls:

1. The letter **φ** (phi) materializes — drawn with calligraphic stroke animation, warm ink on dark ground
2. **ω** (omega) follows — the long "o" vowel
3. **ν** (nu) — a quick downstroke
4. **ή** (eta with accent) — the final breath

The complete word **φωνή** now glows at display scale (120px+ desktop, 64px+ mobile). Below it:

**Transliteration**: *phonē*
**Translation**: *voice. sound. utterance.*

A beat. Then the essay title fades in below:

**Title**: "Phonē: From Voice to Device"
**Subtitle**: "The 2,800-year biography of the word in your pocket"

**Below subtitle** (after word fully formed):
> *Proto-Indo-European \*bʰeh₂- — "to speak." The same root that gave us fame, fate, and fable also gave us phone. This is its story.*

**Scroll behavior**: Scroll-lock drives the letter animation. After the title is complete, the hero section parallax-scrolls away.

### Hero Technical Spec:
- Full viewport height (100vh) + 2.5 scroll-screens for animation
- Greek characters rendered via web font (Noto Serif, GFS Didot, or similar with full Greek support)
- Background: deep ink-black (#0A0A0F)
- Text: warm papyrus (#F0E8D8)
- Accent: ink-stroke amber (#C4923A)
- Title typography: Display serif, large, generous letter-spacing
- Animation: CSS scroll-driven, stroke-dasharray for calligraphic effect, 60fps target

## Layer 4: Chapter Schema

### Section 1: Origin — "The Greek Word" (8th c. BCE – 1st c. CE)

**Narrative arc**: The reader enters the world of ancient Greek, where φωνή was not a technical term but a living word — used by poets, philosophers, and playwrights to name the human voice, the cry of pain, the sound of instruments, and even language itself.

**Sections**:

1. **"φωνή"** — The word in Homer. Voice and sound in the Iliad and Odyssey. φωνή as the breath that carries meaning. The mouth as the original phone.
   - *Typography*: The word φωνή at display scale, surrounded by its LSJ definitions radiating outward like a constellation: "voice," "sound," "utterance," "cry," "language," "dialect," "tone"
   - *Photo*: Greek black-figure or red-figure pottery showing a scene of speech or performance (V1) — the physical world where φωνή was a living word
   - *Photo*: Papyrus fragment or manuscript page containing ancient Greek text (V2)
   - *Research*: S1 (Beekes), S2 (LSJ)

2. **"Sound Significant by Convention"** — Aristotle's *De Interpretatione*. φωνή σημαντική κατὰ συνθήκην — voice that carries meaning by human agreement, not by nature. The first philosophy of language.
   - *Typography*: The Greek phrase displayed as a typographic monument, with English translation layered beneath
   - *Photo*: Ancient Greek theater ruins (Epidaurus or Athens) — the space designed to carry φωνή (V3)
   - *Photo*: Medieval manuscript copy of Aristotle's works, showing the transmission chain (V4)
   - *Quote*: Q1 (Aristotle: "Spoken words are the symbols of mental experience")
   - *Quote*: Q2 (Aristotle: "A name is a spoken sound significant by convention")
   - *Research*: S7 (De Interpretatione)

3. **"Seven Senses"** — The semantic range of φωνή across ancient Greek. Not just "voice" — also sound, cry, language, dialect, pronunciation, vowel. A word with seven lives, each feeding into its future.
   - *Typography*: Animated semantic map — φωνή at center, seven senses radiating outward, each pulsing when scrolled into focus
   - *Photo*: Close-up of Greek inscription carved in stone — the word made permanent in marble (V5)
   - *Research*: S2 (LSJ), S12 (Horrocks)

**Layout patterns**: Full-bleed typography → semantic constellation → philosophical quote monument → animated semantic map

---

### Section 2: The Latin Bridge (1st c. BCE – 17th c. CE)

**Narrative arc**: φωνή doesn't enter Latin directly (Latin had *vōx*). Instead, Greek compounds containing φωνή filter into Latin through scholarship and the Church, then into early modern European languages. The word sleeps for centuries — waiting.

**Sections**:

4. **"The Sleeping Root"** — How Greek φωνή survived in Latin compounds: *symphonia*, *euphonia*, *cacophonia*. The Church and monasteries as preservation vessels. The root is dormant but alive.
   - *Typography*: A timeline showing the three ancient compounds entering English — symphony (1590s), euphony (1623), cacophony (1656) — as quiet arrivals, spaced far apart
   - *Photo*: Illuminated medieval manuscript page — a monastery scriptorium product preserving Greek learning (V6)
   - *Photo*: Renaissance-era printed book with Greek and Latin text side by side (V7)
   - *Research*: S3 (OED), S12 (Horrocks)

5. **"Why Greek?"** — The Renaissance and Enlightenment chose Greek for scientific vocabulary. Latin had *vōx* and *sonus*, but Greek *phonē* was more versatile for compounds. *Telephone* sounds authoritative; *fariloquium* does not. The prestige of Greek in European science.
   - *Typography*: Side-by-side typographic comparison: Greek compounds (clean, precise) vs. hypothetical Latin equivalents (clunky, rejected)
   - *Photo*: 18th/19th century scientific instrument cabinet or Royal Society interior — the institutional world that chose Greek (V8)
   - *Insight voice*: "Greek became the LEGO of scientific naming — modular roots that snap together into precise meanings."
   - *Research*: S6 (Marchand), S12 (Horrocks)

**Layout patterns**: Sparse timeline → typographic comparison → insight callout

---

### Section 3: The Compound Explosion (1827 – 1900)

**Narrative arc**: In 70 years, Greek φωνή spawns more new English words than it had in the previous 2,500 years combined. The 19th century's appetite for invention — and for naming inventions — turns a quiet Greek root into the most productive combining form in telecommunications.

**Sections**:

6. **"The First Compounds"** — Wheatstone coins *microphone* (1827) for an acoustic amplifier. Sudré coins *téléphone* (~1828) for a failed musical system. The words exist before the inventions they'll eventually name.
   - *Typography*: Morphological anatomy — micro|phone and tele|phone displayed as color-coded compound breakdowns, with Greek roots labeled
   - *Photo*: Wheatstone's acoustic instruments / concertina — the physical devices behind the words (V9)
   - *Scroll-lock*: The Compound Builder begins here
   - *Research*: S3 (OED), S14 (Etymonline)

7. **"The Sax-Sound"** — Adolphe Sax patents the saxophone (1846). The name = Sax + phonē, "the sound of Sax." The only major instrument named after a person + the Greek word for voice. φωνή enters the world of music.
   - *Typography*: The word SAXOPHONE split into SAX|O|PHONE — the personal name + the ancient root
   - *Photo*: Adolphe Sax portrait and/or original saxophone from the 1840s (V10)
   - *Photo*: Sax's 1846 patent illustration (V11)
   - *Research*: S14 (Etymonline)

8. **"The Family Grows"** — xylophone (wood-sound, 1866), megaphone (great-sound, 1878), gramophone (writing-sound, 1887). Each compound is a miniature etymology lesson. The -phone/-graph distinction crystallizes: -phone = transmission, -graph = recording.
   - *Scroll-lock*: The Family Tree begins to grow — starting from φωνή and branching outward
   - *Typography*: The word family tree (from WORD-FAMILY.md) animates as a growing branching structure
   - *Photo*: Victorian-era xylophone, Edison's megaphone, Berliner's gramophone — a gallery of -phone/-graph devices (V12, V13, V14)
   - *Research*: S3 (OED), S14 (Etymonline), WORD-FAMILY.md

9. **"The Telephone Before the Telephone"** — The word *telephone* existed for 48 years (1828–1876) before Bell's device. Sudré's musical system, Bourseul's 1854 concept paper, Reis's 1861 *Telephon* in Frankfurt. Three inventions, one word — waiting for the right device.
   - *Typography*: Timeline showing the word *telephone* appearing in 1828, floating unattached, then docking to devices: Sudré (rejected), Reis (incomplete), Bell (permanent)
   - *Photo*: Reis's 1861 Telephon device — the strange, primitive apparatus (V15)
   - *Photo*: Bourseul's 1854 article in *L'Illustration* (reproduction) (V16)
   - *Quote*: Q3 (Bourseul: "Speak against one diaphragm...")
   - *Research*: S17 (Bourseul), S9 (Reis), S3 (OED)

**Layout patterns**: Compound anatomy → scroll-lock compound builder → word family tree → floating-word timeline

---

### Section 4: The Bell Moment (1876)

**Narrative arc**: February 14, 1876. Bell files his patent. The Greek compound *telephone* becomes the most famous word of the industrial age. But the deeper story is biographical: Bell's life was about voice before it was about wires.

**Sections**:

10. **"The Voice Family"** — Bell's father, Alexander Melville Bell, invented Visible Speech (a phonetic notation system). His grandfather, Alexander Bell, was an elocution professor. Alexander Graham Bell was a professor of vocal physiology at Boston University. His wife, Mabel, was deaf. The man who gave the world the *telephone* spent his life studying φωνή.
    - *Typography*: A family tree — but instead of a genealogy of people, a genealogy of voice: grandfather (elocution) → father (Visible Speech) → Bell (the telephone). Three generations of phonē.
    - *Photo*: Alexander Graham Bell portrait — the iconic bearded profile (V17, Library of Congress)
    - *Photo*: Alexander Melville Bell's Visible Speech chart — a phonetic system for the deaf, predecessor to the telephone (V18)
    - *Photo*: Mabel Hubbard Bell — the deaf woman who married the man who made the world hear at a distance (V19)
    - *Research*: S11 (Casson), S15 (Everson)

11. **"Patent 174,465"** — February 14, 1876: Bell files US Patent 174,465, "Improvement in Telegraphy." Elisha Gray files a telephone caveat the same day. Bell's application arrives hours earlier. The most consequential few hours in the history of naming.
    - *Typography*: The patent number displayed as typographic monument — large, stark, authoritative. Below: "Filed: February 14, 1876. The word *telephone* became legally real."
    - *Photo*: The original patent drawing — Bell's technical illustration of the telephone mechanism (V20, US Patent Office)
    - *Photo*: Bell's laboratory / the original telephone prototype (V21)
    - *Photo*: Elisha Gray portrait — the man who lost the word by hours (V22)
    - *Quote*: Q4 (Bell: "Mr. Watson — come here — I want to see you.")
    - *Research*: S8 (Bell Patent), S15 (Everson)

12. **"The Word Goes Global"** — Within a year of Bell's patent, *telephone* enters every European language: French *téléphone*, German *Telefon*, Spanish *teléfono*, Italian *telefono*. East Asian languages calque the concept instead: Japanese 電話 (*denwa*, "electric speech"), Mandarin 电话 (*diànhuà*, "electric speech"). Arabic coins هاتف (*hātif*, "caller"). Finnish invents *puhelin* ("speaking-instrument").
    - *Typography*: The word TELEPHONE at center, with translations radiating outward in their native scripts — a linguistic starburst showing how one Greek compound became a global word
    - *Photo*: Early telephone exchange — rows of operators connecting calls, the word made physical infrastructure (V23)
    - *Photo*: First telephone directory / advertisement from the 1870s–1880s (V24)
    - *Research*: WORD-FAMILY.md (cross-linguistic section)

**Layout patterns**: Voice genealogy → patent monument → linguistic starburst

---

### Section 5: The Great Truncation (1878 – 1995)

**Narrative arc**: The most dramatic clipping in English. Within two years of Bell's patent, *telephone* loses its first four letters. Within fifty years, *phone* is standard. Within a century, it's generating its own compounds. The child has overtaken the parent.

**Sections**:

13. **"Two Years"** — 1878: The Des Moines Register uses *phone* — the first attestation. The clipping happened at the speed of adoption. When a word becomes so common it sheds its prefix, linguists call it clipping. *Telephone* → *phone* is one of the fastest major clippings in English history.
    - *Typography*: The word TELEPHONE displayed large. The letters T-E-L-E pulse, then fade. PHONE remains. A counter below: "Time from invention to clipping: 2 years."
    - *Photo*: Edison with the phonograph (1877–1878) — the era when -phone words were everywhere (V25)
    - *Photo*: Early candlestick telephone, ~1890s — the device people first called "the phone" (V26)
    - *Scroll-lock*: The Great Truncation animation begins
    - *Research*: S3 (OED), S14 (Etymonline)

14. **"The Apostrophe That Vanished"** — In formal writing, the clipped form was initially written as *'phone* — the apostrophe marking the missing *tele-*. By the 1920s, the apostrophe was gone. *Phone* was no longer an abbreviation. It was a word.
    - *Typography*: 'PHONE → PHONE. The apostrophe floats, then drifts away. The moment a clipping becomes a word.
    - *Photo*: Newspaper clipping or dictionary page from the 1890s–1920s showing 'phone with apostrophe (V27)
    - *Quote*: Q6 (Century Dictionary 1895: "A colloquial shortening of telephone...")
    - *Research*: S3 (OED), S18 (Century Dict.)

15. **"Phone Builds Its Own Family"** — Once *phone* started generating compounds — *phone bill* (1901), *phone booth* (1906), *phone book* (1920) — it was no longer a shortened *telephone*. It was an independent word. Linguistically, a clipping achieves independence when it produces its own offspring.
    - *Typography*: The word PHONE at left. Compound words extend rightward: PHONE BOOTH, PHONE BOOK, PHONE CALL, PHONE TAG, CAR PHONE, CELL PHONE — building a new family from the clipped form.
    - *Photo*: Classic red phone booth (London, ~1930s–1960s) — the word made architecture (V28)
    - *Photo*: Phone operator at switchboard, mid-20th century (V29)
    - *Photo*: Rotary dial phone — the iconic mid-century "phone" (V30)
    - *Photo*: Phone book / Yellow Pages — the word as institution (V31)
    - *Insight voice*: "When a clipped form starts making its own compounds, the parent word is no longer needed. Phone didn't just shorten telephone — it replaced it."
    - *Research*: S6 (Marchand), S10 (Crystal)

**Layout patterns**: Truncation animation → apostrophe disappearance → compound-building cascade

---

### Section 6: The Smartphone Singularity (1995 – Present)

**Narrative arc**: A word that meant "voice" in ancient Greek now names a device whose primary functions are visual. The phone has outlived its name. This is semantic fossilization — and it tells us something profound about how language works.

**Sections**:

16. **"smart + phone"** — 1995: "smart phone" appears in print. 1997: Ericsson coins *smartphone* as one word. 2007: iPhone. The word *phone* now names a pocket computer. Voice calling is one function among dozens.
    - *Typography*: The word SMARTPHONE split into SMART|PHONE — the adjective + the ancient Greek root, 2,800 years apart, joined in a single compound
    - *Photo*: The evolution of the phone device — gallery of 4–5 images in sequence: 1980s brick phone → 1990s Nokia → BlackBerry → iPhone 1st gen → modern smartphone (V32–V36)
    - *Research*: S13 (Algeo), WORD-FAMILY.md

17. **"The Voice That Isn't"** — In 2025, a typical smartphone user makes voice calls for less than 15 minutes per day. The device named after the Greek word for "voice" is primarily a camera, messenger, browser, map, wallet, and library. We call it a *phone* — but it isn't one.
    - *Scroll-lock*: The Paradox animation — PHONE surrounded by orbiting function icons, the voice icon fading
    - *Photo*: Person staring at smartphone screen — eyes, not mouth, engaged with the "phone" (V37)
    - *Insight voice*: "φωνή meant voice. Phone means everything."

18. **"Semantic Fossilization"** — Like *pen* (from Latin *penna*, "feather"), *phone* carries the fossil of an obsolete technology inside its name. The word preserves a meaning the object has abandoned. This is how language works: names outlive their origins. Every word is an archaeology.
    - *Typography*: Three fossil words displayed: PEN (feather → writing instrument), DIAL (sundial → rotate a number), PHONE (voice → pocket computer). Each with its ancient meaning ghosted behind the modern meaning.
    - *Photo*: Final image — a human hand holding a smartphone, fingers on glass. The caption: "φωνή — voice — in the palm of your hand." (V38)
    - *Closing text*: "The next time you pick up your phone, you are picking up a word that is 2,800 years old. It meant voice. It meant sound. It meant the breath that carries meaning from one mind to another. The device has changed. The word remembers."

**Layout patterns**: Compound split → function orbit → fossil comparison → closing reflection

### Animation Philosophy

**"The Written Word"** — This essay's animation should feel like watching language being written, transmitted, and transformed. Motion evokes inscription, transmission across wire, and the quiet accumulation of meaning over centuries.

- **Preferred easing**: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` — Material Design standard: purposeful, not showy
- **Greek letter appearance**: Stroke animation (stroke-dasharray/dashoffset), 800ms per character — like watching a scribe
- **Compound assembly**: Elements slide and dock with `ease-out`, 400ms — mechanical, like a printing press
- **Tree growth**: Branches extend with `ease-in-out`, 600ms — organic, like a living word growing
- **Truncation**: Letters fade with `ease-out`, 500ms — gradual loss, like erosion
- **Era transitions**: Background color crossfade, 800ms — the word moving through time
- **Scroll-driven**: All major animations tied to scroll position, not time
- **`prefers-reduced-motion`**: All animations collapse to simple opacity fades, 200ms

### Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| 375px | iPhone SE | Minimum supported; single-column, Greek at 48px |
| 390px | iPhone 14/15 | Primary mobile target; Greek at 64px |
| 768px | iPad | Two-column for compound anatomy sections |
| 1024px | Desktop small | Full layout with parallax and tree visualization |

```

### Component Architecture

- **page.tsx**: Server component with Next.js metadata export, ESSAY_META object, wraps in ArtifactDetailWrapper
- **TheWordPhoneClient.tsx**: Client component containing all interactive logic
  - IntersectionObserver for section tracking
  - Scroll-lock manager for 5 scroll-lock sequences
  - CompoundBuilder state (8 compound animations)
  - FamilyTree SVG state (30+ nodes, progressive reveal)
  - TruncationAnimation state (TELEPHONE → PHONE)
  - ParadoxOrbit state (function icons orbiting PHONE)
  - Progress bar word-transformation state

### SVG Visualizations Required

1. **Semantic Constellation** (Section 1): φωνή at center, 7 senses radiating — interactive hover/focus
2. **Compound Anatomy Diagrams** (Section 3): 6–8 words with color-coded root breakdowns
3. **Word Family Tree** (Section 3/4): Branching tree from PIE root → 30+ descendants — scroll-animated growth
4. **Linguistic Starburst** (Section 4): TELEPHONE at center, 10+ translations in native scripts radiating
5. **Compound Cascade** (Section 5): PHONE generating offspring compounds — sequential build animation
6. **Fossil Comparison** (Section 6): Three parallel word histories (pen, dial, phone) with ghost etymologies

### Archival Photography Requirements

**Total target: 28–38 images** across 6 eras. All images must be public domain (Wikimedia Commons, Library of Congress, Smithsonian, patent archives) or CC-licensed.

| Era | Image Count | Primary Sources |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| Ancient Greek (Section 1) | 5 (V1–V5) | Wikimedia Commons (pottery, manuscripts, theater, inscriptions) |
| Latin Bridge (Section 2) | 3 (V6–V8) | Wikimedia Commons (manuscripts, early printed books, scientific institutions) |
| Compound Explosion (Section 3) | 8 (V9–V16) | Patent archives, Wikimedia (instruments, inventors, patents) |
| Bell Moment (Section 4) | 8 (V17–V24) | Library of Congress, US Patent Office, Wikimedia (Bell, Gray, exchanges) |
| Great Truncation (Section 5) | 7 (V25–V31) | Library of Congress, Wikimedia (phones, booths, operators, directories) |
| Smartphone Era (Section 6) | 7 (V32–V38) | CC-licensed stock, editorial (device evolution, modern usage) |

**Image processing by era:**
- Greek/Latin: Warm sepia toning, parchment-compatible, softened edges
- 19th century: Period-appropriate processing — daguerreotype grain, patent-drawing clarity
- Bell era: Sepia-to-warm-monochrome, archival quality
- Mid-century: Black-and-white or desaturated Kodachrome
- Modern: Clean, high-contrast, glass-blue color grading

### CSS Architecture

- All design tokens as CSS custom properties (from Layer 5 palette)
- Era-specific sections with palette overrides via `data-era` attributes:
  - `data-era="greek"`: ink-black bg, papyrus text, terracotta accent
  - `data-era="latin"`: sepia bg tint, vellum surfaces
  - `data-era="compound"`: technical-blue accents, patent-cream surfaces
  - `data-era="bell"`: copper accents, warm tones
  - `data-era="modern"`: glass-blue accents, aluminum surfaces
- Mobile-first: base styles for 375px, progressive enhancement upward
- Scroll-lock sections use `position: sticky` + `overflow: hidden` pattern
- Greek character rendering: explicit `font-feature-settings` for proper diacritics
- Dark mode for hero and section transitions; light mode for body reading sections

### Performance Budget

| Asset | Budget | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Total JS (gzip) | < 120KB | Client component + SVG interactions |
| Total CSS (gzip) | < 25KB | All styles including era palettes |
| Font files | < 200KB | Cormorant Garamond + GFS Didot + Source Serif 4 + Inter + JetBrains Mono (subsetted) |
| Largest SVG | < 50KB | Word family tree (optimized, progressive render) |
| Largest image | < 200KB | WebP, lazy-loaded with blur-up placeholder |
| Total image weight | < 2MB | All 28–38 images, WebP, progressive loading |
| LCP | < 2.5s | Hero φωνή characters |
| CLS | < 0.1 | No layout shift from deferred SVGs |
| Scroll FPS | ≥ 55fps | Target 60fps, minimum 55fps |

### Interaction State Machine

```
Hero → [scroll-lock: The Word Appears]
  → Section 1: Origin (Greek)
  → Section 2: The Latin Bridge
  → Section 3: The Compound Explosion
    → [scroll-lock: The Compound Builder]
    → [scroll-lock: The Family Tree]

```

### Accessibility

- All scroll-lock sequences have skip affordances
- `prefers-reduced-motion`: Disable parallax, disable stroke animations, show final states immediately
- All SVG diagrams have descriptive `<title>` and `<desc>` elements
- All Greek characters have `lang="el"` attribute for screen readers
- Color contrast: ≥4.5:1 for body text, ≥3:1 for large display text
- Keyboard: All interactive compound anatomy diagrams and tree nodes keyboard-navigable (Tab + Enter)
- Focus indicators: visible focus rings on all interactive elements
- ARIA: Section landmarks, heading hierarchy, `role="img"` for SVG diagrams with aria-label
