### Typography Palette

**Display/Headlines**:
- Era 1–2: EB Garamond + Playfair Display
- Era 3: Libre Baskerville + Roboto Slab
- Era 4: Special Elite + Oswald
- Era 5–6: Inter + Space Grotesk

**Body Text**: Libre Baskerville or Lora (transitional serif)

### Color Palette

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Scoundrel's Ink | `#1a1a1a` | Primary text |
| Aged Vellum | `#f5f0e6` | Background Era 1–3 |
| Candlelight | `#c9a227` | Accents Era 1 |
| Dictionary Red | `#8b2332` | Key terms, citations |
| Newsprint Cream | `#faf8f0` | Background Era 4 |
| Interface Blue | `#2563eb` | Era 6 elements |

### Animation Philosophy
- **Motion Character**: Measured, archival—like pages turning, type setting
- **Transitions**: Fade and reveal dominant
- **Era Shifts**: Subtle paper texture changes
- **Speed**: Early eras slower (0.8–1.2s), modern faster (0.3–0.5s)

### Progress Bar Concept
Visual metaphor: A dictionary entry being written
- Start: Blank ledger line
- Progress: Handwritten letters appear, forming "SLANG"
- End: Complete typeset dictionary definition

## VISUAL PLATES SPECIFICATIONS

### PLATE 1: Title Spread
- **Image**: Letterpress type blocks spelling S-L-A-N-G, mismatched faces
- **Caption**: The word *slang* first appeared in 1756, describing the secret vocabulary of London's criminal underworld. Its etymology remains disputed—perhaps derived from Scandinavian words for wandering or loose movement. Like the language it names, the word resists easy classification.
- **Typography**: Heavy condensed wood-type slab-serif
- **Alt Text**: Wooden letterpress blocks spelling SLANG in mismatched typefaces

### PLATE 2: Criminal Underground
- **Image**: Hogarth's "Gin Lane" (1751) detail
- **Caption**: By the 1740s, *slang* crystallized into a word "chiefly found in reports of the speech of an underclass of thieves, beggars, and itinerants." To know slang was to know the "scoundrel's dictionary"—a secret tongue designed to exclude outsiders and evade authorities.
- **Typography**: Blackletter display; Caslon body
- **Alt Text**: William Hogarth's 1751 engraving Gin Lane

### PLATE 3: First Attestation
- **Image**: Period paper texture with typeset quote
- **Caption**: William Toldervy's 1756 novel *The History of Two Orphans* contains the earliest confirmed use of *slang* as a noun: "Thomas Throw had been upon the town, knew the slang well...and understood every word in the scoundrel's dictionary."
- **Typography**: Transitional serif; 1756 date stamp
- **Alt Text**: Aged paper with typeset quotation from 1756 novel

### PLATE 4: The Roadside Verge
- **Image**: Narrow strip of waste ground, Northern English countryside
- **Caption**: The leading etymology traces *slang* to a Northern English dialect word for "a narrow piece of land." Philologist Isaac Taylor proposed that the camping grounds of itinerant hawkers became synonymous with their language. Territory became vocabulary.
- **Typography**: Vernacular sans-serif; muted earth tones
- **Alt Text**: Photograph of narrow grassy verge beside rural English road

### PLATE 5: Grose's Dictionary
- **Image**: Title page, *Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue* (1785)
- **Caption**: Thirty years after Samuel Johnson excluded "low bad words" from his *Dictionary*, Captain Francis Grose embraced them. His 1785 work recorded 9,000 terms collected through "nocturnal sallies" into London's slums—the first major work to treat slang as worthy of preservation.
- **Typography**: Didone display; dictionary-style columns
- **Alt Text**: Title page of Francis Grose's 1785 Classical Dictionary

### PLATE 6: Francis Grose Portrait
- **Image**: Francesco Bartolozzi engraving
- **Caption**: Captain Francis Grose (1731–1791) was militia captain, antiquary, and lexicographer. With his assistant Tom Cocking, he roamed London's shadier establishments collecting slang. By cataloguing the vulgar tongue, Grose began bringing slang from margin to center.
- **Typography**: Georgian Didone; formal portrait treatment
- **Alt Text**: 18th-century engraved portrait of Captain Francis Grose

### PLATE 7: Etymology and Uncertainty
- **Image**: Layered typography showing theories fading to "ORIGIN UNKNOWN"
- **Caption**: Despite 250 years of scholarly attention, no etymology of *slang* has been definitively proven. The OED calls Isaac Taylor's theory "the prime but unproven suspect." Merriam-Webster states simply: "origin unknown." The word resists the very classification it would impose on others.
- **Typography**: Multiple overlaid faces; stark final state
- **Alt Text**: Typographic composition with etymology theories fading to question marks

### PLATE 8: H.L. Mencken
- **Image**: Carl Van Vechten photograph (1932), Library of Congress
- **Caption**: H.L. Mencken's *The American Language* (1919) inverted class dynamics: "Slang in its origin is nearly always respectable. It is devised not by the stupid populace, but by individuals of wit and ingenuity." Slang as creativity, not moral failure.
- **Typography**: American Typewriter display; newsprint palette
- **Alt Text**: Black and white photograph of H.L. Mencken at his desk

### PLATE 9: British Museum Reading Room
- **Image**: Dome interior, British Museum Reading Room
- **Caption**: Eric Partridge occupied desk K1 in the British Museum Reading Room for fifty years, compiling *A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English* (1937). His work professionalized slang scholarship, though critics noted his etymologies sometimes "strayed from the plausible to the fanciful."
- **Typography**: Gill Sans display; British Modernist restraint
- **Alt Text**: Domed ceiling of British Museum Reading Room

### PLATE 10: Academic Legitimacy
- **Image**: University campus, students in conversation
- **Caption**: Connie Eble's *Slang and Sociability* (1996) defined slang as vocabulary that "creates solidarity within a social group"—not linguistic failure, but social function. The word *slang* had finally entered the academy that once excluded it.
- **Typography**: Humanist sans-serif; clean academic layout
- **Alt Text**: Diverse college students in conversation on campus

### PLATE 11: The Digital Flood
- **Image**: Stylized Urban Dictionary interface mockup
- **Caption**: Urban Dictionary (founded 1999) hosts over 500,000 definitions—democratized, user-generated, ungovernable. Where Grose walked London's streets, anyone with internet access can now submit definitions. Lexicography has been crowdsourced. Gatekeeping has collapsed.
- **Typography**: Variable sans-serif; UI patterns; bright accents
- **Alt Text**: Stylized mockup of Urban Dictionary interface

### PLATE 12: Closing — The Living Word
- **Image**: Abstract close-up of mouth speaking, motion blur
- **Caption**: *Slang* names the language that refuses to hold still—born in criminal shadows, catalogued by subversive lexicographers, defended by American iconoclasts, crowdsourced by millions. To trace *slang* is to trace living language itself.
- **Typography**: Layered typefaces from all eras; clean serif coda
- **Alt Text**: Abstract photograph of lips in motion while speaking
