# Visual Essay Invocation: SLANG — The Word That Named the Unnameable

## Layer 1: Strategic Foundation

### Project Title
**SLANG** — *The Word That Named the Unnameable*

### Executive Brief

**Emotional Throughline**: A word that names the ungovernable edge of language—born in 18th-century criminal underworlds, "slang" evolved from a term of contempt into a celebration of linguistic creativity. Its etymology remains genuinely uncertain, a fitting mystery for a word that captures humanity's restless urge to reinvent how we speak.

**Stakes**: Slang is how language stays alive. Understanding the word "slang" reveals the power dynamics of who gets to name speech as legitimate or deviant—and why generations keep inventing new words to escape the ones their parents use.

**Transformation Promise**: The reader will move from seeing "slang" as just an informal label to understanding it as a 270-year-old battleground between linguistic authority and creative rebellion.

**Central Question**: Where did this word come from—and why does it feel a little rebellious to use it?

### Visual Treatment Philosophy

**Primary Medium**: Photo-driven visual essay with era-evolving typography
- Archival photographs and documents (18th century onward)
- Dictionary page close-ups and manuscript textures
- Period ephemera (pamphlets, newspapers, zines)
- Modern digital compositions (text bubbles, meme aesthetics)

**Typography as Narrative Device**: 
Fonts evolve across chapters to mirror slang's journey through cultural eras:
- 1750s–1800s: Classical serif (Caslon, Baskerville)
- 1850s–1900s: Victorian display (Clarendon)
- 1920s: Art Deco accents (Broadway, Futura)
- 1950s–1970s: Mid-century modern (Helvetica)
- 1980s–2000s: Bold condensed (Impact aesthetic)
- 2010s–2020s: Digital/UI (System fonts, emoji integration)

**Era Processing**:
| Era | Treatment |
|-----|-----------|
| 1750s–1800s | Sepia tones, paper texture, candlelit warmth |
| 1850s–1900s | Victorian high contrast, engraving aesthetic |
| 1920s | Jazz age warmth, speakeasy lighting |
| 1950s–1970s | Mid-century color, documentary grain |
| 1980s–2000s | Urban grit, neon accents, high contrast |
| 2010s–2020s | Digital clean, screen-glow aesthetic |

## Layer 2: Technical Systems

### Scroll-Lock Specification

**Behavior**: Viewport-locking scroll sequences at chapter transitions and key revelations
**Duration**: 3-6 seconds equivalent scroll distance (300-600vh per major sequence)
**Skip Affordance**: Double-tap to skip, visible skip button at bottom-right
**Easing**: `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` for smooth lock/unlock
**Mobile Consideration**: Touch-scroll maintains same ratios, reduced parallax intensity

### Parallax Depth System

Four-layer depth model:

| Layer | Speed Ratio | Content Type |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Background | 0.3x | Era-tinted gradients, paper textures |
| Deep Mid | 0.5x | Dictionary pages, archival context |
| Subject | 1.0x | Portraits, primary documents, quotes |
| Overlay | 1.3x | Typography treatments, era fonts |

### Themed Progress Indicator

**Concept**: **"The Dictionary Page"**

Progress visualized as a dictionary entry being written letter-by-letter:

- 0%: Blank dictionary page, quill ready
- 11%: "S" appears (Chapter A: The Spark)
- 22%: "SL" (Chapter B: Birth Certificate)
- 33%: "SLA" (Chapter C: The Mystery)
- 44%: "SLAN" (Chapter D: Social Life)
- 56%: "SLANG" complete (Chapter E: Timeline)
- 67%: Definition begins writing (Chapter F: Global)
- 78%: Definition continues (Chapter G: Gatekeepers)
- 89%: Definition continues (Chapter H: Digital)
- 100%: Full entry glows, page turns (Chapter I: Closing)

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy-load era-specific font files
- Preload hero images
- Use CSS-only animations where possible
- Intersection Observer for chapter transitions

### Accessibility

- Ensure all era fonts have readable fallbacks
- Provide audio descriptions for visual montages
- Maintain minimum contrast ratios across all era palettes
- Skip links for each major chapter

### Bibliography Section

Include at end:
