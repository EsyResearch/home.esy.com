# Design Research Report: Etymology — The Word That Dug Up Words

**Date**: 2024-12-23
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Gate**: G4 - Design Research

---

## Design Research Overview

This visual essay traces the 2,500-year journey of the word "etymology" from ancient Greek philosophy through Roman translation, medieval encyclopedia, scientific linguistics, and into the digital age. The design challenge is to visually represent the concept of *digging* — both archaeological excavation and scholarly investigation — while transitioning through distinct historical eras, each with authentic visual language.

The subject is inherently meta-linguistic: a word about words, a study that studies studying. This creates a unique design opportunity to make typography itself a protagonist, where the visual identity emerges from the materials of language: stone inscriptions, manuscript illuminations, printed type, and digital interfaces.

## Visual Identity Analysis

### Subject Matter Characteristics

**Subject IS**:
- Scholarly and intellectual (rooted in philosophy, philology, lexicography)
- Archaeological in metaphor (digging, uncovering, excavating meaning)
- Multi-era spanning (ancient Greece to digital present, ~2,500 years)
- Typography-centric (words as visual artifacts, letters as objects)
- Progressive/evolutionary (meanings shift, methods improve, knowledge accumulates)
- Meta-linguistic (self-referential: a word about studying words)
- Dusty, archival, library-scented (manuscripts, dictionaries, citation slips)

**Subject is NOT**:
- Flashy, trendy, or contemporary-feeling
- Abstract or purely conceptual (it has physical artifacts: manuscripts, books, type)
- Colorful or vibrant (it's scholarly, understated, dignified)
- Fast-paced or energetic (it's slow, patient, cumulative)
- Illustrated or fantastical (it's grounded in photography of real artifacts)
- Playful without purpose (wit is welcome, but always in service of meaning)

### Visual Treatment Decision

**Primary Medium**: Photorealistic / Archival Photography

**Rationale**:
1. Etymology's history is *documented* — manuscripts, inscriptions, portraits, dictionaries exist as physical artifacts that can be photographed
2. The archaeological metaphor (excavating meaning) is strengthened by real textures: stone, vellum, paper, type metal
3. Key figures (Plato, Isidore, Johnson, Murray, Grimm) have historical portraits or busts that ground the narrative in faces
4. Typography itself becomes photographic subject: inscriptions, manuscript initials, wood type, lead type
5. The progression through eras is visually marked by authentic materials from each period

## Proposed Color Palette

### Color Derivation Table

| Token | Hex | Source | Derivation |
|-------|-----|--------|------------|
| Primary Background | #0D0D0D | Night library, unlit scriptorium | Deep black for dramatic contrast against artifacts |
| Secondary Background | #1A1A1F | Shadowed archive shelving | Slightly warm charcoal for layered depth |
| Accent Primary | #C9A227 | Gold leaf from illuminated manuscripts | Direct extraction from Byzantine/medieval gold |
| Accent Secondary | #8B4513 | Saddle leather, aged vellum edges | Library binding leather, manuscript edges |
| Era: Ancient | #D4AF37 | Aged bronze, antique gold | Greek/Roman metalwork patina |
| Era: Medieval | #722F37 | Vermillion rubric ink | Manuscript red (iron oxide pigment) |
| Era: Print | #4A3728 | Wood type, oak furniture | Composing room wood, library mahogany |
| Era: Scientific | #1E3A5F | Academic Oxford blue | University robes, scholarly authority |
| Era: Digital | #00A0B0 | Screen cyan, hyperlink teal | Interface blue, clickable affordance |
| Text Primary | #FFFFFF @ 95% | Paper white, high contrast | Maximum readability against dark |
| Text Secondary | #FFFFFF @ 60% | Faded inscription | Hierarchy, subdued labels |
| Stone Gray | #A9A9A9 | Marble, weathered inscription | Greek/Roman monument stone |
| Parchment | #F5F0E6 | Medieval vellum | Warm off-white, organic texture |
| Ink Black | #1A1A1A | Oak gall ink, printer's ink | True archival black |

### Color Psychology Justification

- **Deep Black (#0D0D0D)**: Evokes the unlit archive, the moment before discovery, the void from which knowledge emerges. Creates dramatic stage for artifacts to appear.

- **Gold (#C9A227)**: Direct from illuminated manuscripts — connotes sacred knowledge, medieval scholarship, the "illumination" of understanding. Used sparingly for highlights and key terms.

- **Vermillion/Wine (#722F37)**: The rubric color — in manuscripts, red was used for titles, important passages. Connotes authority, emphasis, the special status of key information.

- **Oxford Blue (#1E3A5F)**: The color of academic robes, scholarly institutions. Represents the 19th-century professionalization of philology.

- **Digital Teal (#00A0B0)**: Clean break from historical palette — marks the digital era, hyperlinks, search interfaces. Signals modernity without feeling generic.

## Typography Selection

### Typography Stack

**Display**: Playfair Display — because it bridges Enlightenment elegance with digital clarity; its high contrast and slightly bracketed serifs evoke the 18th-century transition to "modern" typefaces while remaining screen-optimized.

**Serif Body**: Source Serif Pro — because it's designed for extended reading, balances warmth with precision, and has excellent language support including Greek characters for showing ἔτυμον.

**Quote/Emphasis**: Cormorant Garamond Italic — because Garamond-style faces connect to humanist scholarship; the italic feels like a scholar's marginalia, personal yet authoritative.

**Monospace/Technical**: Fira Code — because IPA transcriptions and morpheme breakdowns require precision spacing; ligatures help with phonetic notation clarity.

**Caption/UI**: Inter — because it's neutral, highly legible at small sizes, and doesn't compete with historical fonts; represents the "invisible" modern layer.

### Typography Justification

**Why Not Blackletter for Medieval?**: While tempting for "authenticity," Blackletter is difficult to read and can feel costumey. Instead, we use era-appropriate *styling* (color, layout, marginalia) while maintaining readability with Cormorant or Playfair.

**Why Playfair Display?**: The essay spans 2,500 years, so we need a display face that feels timeless rather than era-locked. Playfair's high contrast evokes engraved inscriptions and printed title pages without being kitschy. It has the gravitas of history without the inaccessibility.

**Greek Text Treatment**: For actual Greek characters (ἔτυμον, ΕΤΥΜΟΛΟΓΙΑ), use Source Serif Pro which has Greek support, or GFS Didot for display Greek. Never use faux-Greek "font" substitutions.

### Era-Specific Typography Styling

| Era | Display Treatment | Body Treatment | Visual Cues |
|-----|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Ancient | Wide letter-spacing, all-caps inscriptional | Standard serif | Stone texture overlays, high contrast |
| Medieval | Drop caps with decorative initial style | Slightly larger x-height feel | Marginalia elements, rubric color |
| Print | Centered title pages, printer's ornaments | Classic book layout | Justified text, running headers |
| Victorian | Slab serifs for headings if needed | Dense columns | Footnote styling, citation format |
| Digital | System-native UI styling | Clean sans for UI | Search bar aesthetics, metadata tags |

## Animation Philosophy

### Subject Nature Analysis

**Etymology as Subject IS**:
- Patient (scholarship takes time)
- Cumulative (knowledge builds layer by layer)
- Revelatory (hidden meanings uncovered)
- Transformative (words change through time)
- Archaeological (digging, brushing, uncovering)
- Organic in pace (language evolves naturally, not mechanically)

**Etymology as Subject is NOT**:
- Mechanical or industrial
- Fast-paced or energetic
- Flashy or attention-grabbing
- Random or chaotic

### Animation Should:

- Feel like **brushing dust away** — gentle, patient, revealing
- Support **the archaeology metaphor** — things emerge from obscurity
- Reveal **transformation over time** — morphing, evolving, shifting
- Be **contemplative, not urgent** — allow readers to absorb
- Honor **the weight of history** — nothing feels flippant

### Animation Principles

**Scroll-Lock Sequences**:
- Purpose: Mark significant revelations (key morphemes, historical shifts, figure introductions)
- Feel: Like pausing in a museum to absorb an artifact
- Timing: 1500-3000px scroll depth depending on complexity
- Easing: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1) — smooth deceleration, no bounce

**The Primary Animation Pattern: "The Reveal"**
- Content emerges from obscurity: blur clears, dust settles, focus sharpens
- Metaphor: the etymologist uncovering meaning beneath surface
- Implementation: Gaussian blur (12px → 0px), opacity (0 → 1), scale (0.95 → 1)

**The Secondary Pattern: "The Morph"**
- Typography transforms: Greek → Latin → English spellings
- Metaphor: words change over time, same root becomes different forms
- Implementation: letter-by-letter replacement with brief overlap, 80ms per character

**Parallax**:
- Intensity: Moderate — creates depth without distraction
- Rationale: Supports archaeological layering (deeper = older)
- Speed ratios: Background 0.2x, Mid 0.5x, Subject 1x, Overlay 1.2x

**Animation Timing**:
- Major reveals: 600-800ms (significant moments)
- Text fades: 300-400ms (supporting content)
- Stagger between elements: 80-120ms (reading rhythm)
- Scroll-lock lock/unlock: 400ms ease (smooth transition)

**Dust Particle Effect**:
- Subtle floating particles in ambient layer
- Only during archaeological/excavation sections
- Very slow movement (0.1x scroll speed)
- Connotes: age, archive, the physical reality of manuscripts

## Visual Style Guide

### Photorealistic Approach

**Image Treatment by Era**:

| Era | Color Grade | Texture | Processing |
|-----|------------|---------|------------|
| Ancient | Warm sepia, desaturated | Stone grain overlay | High contrast, weathered edges |
| Medieval | Rich jewel tones, warm | Vellum texture overlay | Candlelit warmth, soft vignette |
| Print (1500-1800) | Cream/warm neutral | Paper fiber visible | Clean but warm, type sharp |
| Victorian (1800-1920) | Sepia to early B&W | Photographic grain | Period film simulation |
| Modern (1920-2000) | B&W to full color | Minimal grain | Documentary clarity |
| Digital (2000-present) | Full color, high contrast | No texture overlay | Screen-native clarity |

**Portrait Treatment**:
- Busts and paintings: dramatic directional lighting, dark backgrounds
- Photographs: period-appropriate processing (sepia for Victorian, B&W for early 20th c.)
- No anachronistic treatments (no color for pre-1900 subjects)

### Visual Progression

The essay's visuals should feel like walking through a museum wing:
1. **Gallery 1 (Ancient)**: Stone, marble, inscriptions — cool and monumental
2. **Gallery 2 (Medieval)**: Warm, intimate, candlelit — manuscripts in cases
3. **Gallery 3 (Print)**: Brighter, more organized — books on shelves
4. **Gallery 4 (Victorian)**: Photograph galleries — faces emerging
5. **Gallery 5 (Modern/Digital)**: Clean, well-lit — contemporary exhibition

## Progress Bar Concept

**Concept**: "The Word Trail"

**Visual Design**:
- Position: Left edge, vertical, 4px base width
- Form: A stylized root/branch pattern growing upward
- Base: Greek letter form (Ε for étymon) at bottom
- Top: Modern lowercase 'e' at completion
- Markers: Era-appropriate glyphs at chapter positions
- Active state: Glowing gold accent (#C9A227)
- Hover: Reveals chapter title in tooltip

**Subject Connection**:
- The "root" metaphor is central to etymology
- Growth upward = knowledge accumulating
- Transformation from Greek to modern = the word's own journey
- Organic form (vs. mechanical progress bar) matches subject nature

**Justification**:
Etymology IS the study of word "roots." The progress bar literally visualizes this: you begin at the root (ἔτυμον) and grow upward through history to the present form. It could only exist for this essay.

## Layout Pattern Strategy

### Recommended Patterns (minimum 3, no consecutive same)

1. **Full-Bleed Artifact** (`artifact-showcase`)
   - For: Key manuscript images, portrait reveals, inscription close-ups
   - Description: Image fills viewport, text overlays with dark gradient
   - Rationale: Treats artifacts like museum pieces; commands attention

2. **Split Comparison** (`before-after-split`)
   - For: Etymology Fallacy section, meaning drift comparisons
   - Description: Left/right split with contrasting content
   - Rationale: Etymological work involves comparison; visual format matches method

3. **Text-Lead with Figure** (`scholar-profile`)
   - For: Key figure introductions, quote-heavy sections
   - Description: Large pull quote or portrait, surrounded by body text
   - Rationale: Honors the people who built the discipline; faces ground abstraction

4. **Timeline Scroll** (`horizontal-timeline`)
   - For: Chapter 7 (Meaning Drifts), Chapter 11 (America Adopts)
   - Description: Horizontal scrolling timeline with markers and cards
   - Rationale: Etymology is inherently chronological; timeline is native format

5. **Grid Gallery** (`figure-gallery`)
   - For: Key Figures Gallery (Chapter 13)
   - Description: Portrait grid, each clickable for detail
   - Rationale: 10 figures demand organized presentation; museum gallery feel

6. **Morpheme Assembly** (`building-blocks`)
   - For: Chapter 2 (Pronouncing the Mystery)
   - Description: Word parts appear as discrete blocks, then combine
   - Rationale: Visualizes morphological analysis literally

## Mobile-Native Considerations

### Mobile-First Design

- Scroll-lock sequences remain but simplified (fewer breakpoints)
- Parallax depth reduced to 2 layers (subject + background)
- Progress bar moves to bottom edge (out of thumb zone)
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Gallery grids collapse to single-column swipeable cards

### Typography for Mobile

- Display: 32-40px (Playfair Display)
- Body: 17-18px (Source Serif Pro)
- Line height: 1.6 minimum
- Margins: 16-24px
- Greek/IPA text: may need 10% size boost for legibility

### Touch Interactions

- Skip button: large, bottom-right, always visible during scroll-lock
- Gallery navigation: swipe gestures + explicit arrows
- Progress bar: tap to jump to section
- Image zoom: pinch-to-zoom on artifact close-ups

### Performance Budget (Mobile)

- Initial load: < 3 seconds on 3G
- Images: lazy-loaded, responsive srcset
- Fonts: subset for critical path (Latin + Greek)
- Animations: GPU-accelerated transforms only

---

## Accessibility Requirements

### Reduced Motion

- `prefers-reduced-motion`: disable scroll-lock, reduce parallax to 0
- Provide static alternatives for all animated reveals
- Morphing text: show final state immediately
- Dust particles: disable entirely

### Screen Reader Support

- All images have descriptive alt text (content + context)
- Semantic HTML: proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h6)
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Skip links at top of page and each scroll-lock zone
- Figure captions available as accessible descriptions

### Color Contrast

- Text on dark: #FFFFFF on #0D0D0D = 21:1 (exceeds AAA)
- Text on parchment: #1A1A1A on #F5F0E6 = 14:1 (exceeds AAA)
- Accent on dark: #C9A227 on #0D0D0D = 7.5:1 (exceeds AA for large text)
- All color combinations tested for colorblind accessibility

## Uniqueness Verification

### Comparison to Previous Essays

**NOT Like**:
- **the-word-robot**: Industrial/mechanical aesthetic, Constructivist influence, theatrical red/black. Etymology is scholarly/archival, warm/organic.
- **the-word-dick**: Playful, irreverent, cheeky. Etymology is dignified, patient, cerebral.
- **the-semiconductor-story**: Clean technical diagrams, process flow. Etymology is about language, not manufacturing.
- **the-printing-press**: While related (both involve books), printing-press focuses on industrial revolution, mechanical reproduction. Etymology focuses on intellectual/scholarly tradition.

**IS Like**:
- Some overlap with *language history* essays in scholarly tone, but unique in:
  - Self-referential subject (the word that studies words)
  - Archaeological excavation metaphor as central motif
  - Typography as protagonist (the word itself transforms)
  - Meta-linguistic nature

**Unique Elements**:
1. **The Morphing Word**: The essay's hero is the word "etymology" itself transforming through Greek → Latin → Middle English → Modern — no other essay does this
2. **Archaeological Excavation Metaphor**: Dust clearing, artifacts emerging — grounded in the subject's nature as "digging up" meaning
3. **5-Era Visual System**: Distinct visual treatment for Ancient, Medieval, Print, Victorian, Digital — driven by the subject's 2,500-year span
4. **Progress Bar as Root**: The "Word Trail" progress bar is literally a root growing upward — etymologically unique
5. **Self-Referential Loop**: An essay about etymology that exemplifies etymology — the design is meta

**Conclusion**: Visual identity is **unique** and could only exist for this specific subject.
