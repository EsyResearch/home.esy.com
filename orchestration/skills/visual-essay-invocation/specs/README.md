# Visual Essay Specs

**Finished, production-ready invocation documents** generated by the Visual Essay Invocation Agent.

For format reference and incomplete templates, see [`examples/`](../examples/).

## What Are Specs?

Specs are comprehensive specifications—the complete architectural plans that ensure consistent, high-quality visual essay execution. They include:

- Strategic foundation (title, brief, visual treatment)
- Technical systems (scroll-lock, parallax, progress bar)
- Hero architecture (opening sequence choreography)
- Chapter schema (all chapters with metaphors, figures, scroll-lock sequences)
- Design system (colors, typography, animation principles)
- Implementation requirements (responsive, accessibility, deliverables)

## Workflow

Specs are generated by the **Visual Essay Invocation Agent** (`@agents/visual-essay-invocation-agent.md`):

```
1. User/Template provides topic request
2. Visual Essay Invocation Agent applies the skill framework
3. Agent generates complete six-layer specification
4. Agent stores spec to this directory: specs/[topic-slug].md
5. Visual Essay Orchestrator references spec for production
6. Production Orchestrator implements from spec
```

## Status Levels

Each spec has a status indicating its readiness:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[DRAFT]` | Newly generated, awaiting review |
| `[REVIEWED]` | Human-reviewed, approved for implementation |
| `[IMPLEMENTED]` | Visual essay built from this spec |
| `[CANONICAL]` | Reference-quality, may be promoted to `/references/` |

## Current Specs

| Spec | Status | Topic | Chapters | Figures |
|------|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| `the-ramayana.md` | DRAFT | Hindu epic | 15 | 25+ |

## Using Specs

1. **For Implementation:** Reference the spec path when invoking Production Orchestrator
   ```
   Using @agents/production-orchestrator.md, implement the visual essay 
   from spec at @orchestration/skills/visual-essay-invocation/specs/[topic-slug].md
   ```

2. **For Reference:** Study the structure when learning invocation patterns

3. **For Quality Check:** Compare implementations against spec requirements

## YAML Frontmatter Format

All specs include frontmatter for metadata:

```yaml
---
status: DRAFT
topic: [Topic Name]
generated: [ISO date]
visual_treatment: [photorealistic|illustrated|mythological|mixed]
chapters: [count]
figures: [count]
lens_applied: [lens name or "none"]
---
```

## Promotion Path

```
specs/[DRAFT] → specs/[REVIEWED] → specs/[IMPLEMENTED]
                                          ↓
                          references/ (if canonical quality)
```

## Contributing

New specs are generated via the Visual Essay Invocation Agent:

```
Using @agents/visual-essay-invocation-agent.md, generate a complete 
invocation spec for a visual essay about [TOPIC].
```

The agent will:
1. Apply the skill framework (`SKILL.md`)
2. Apply appropriate lens if topic matches
3. Generate six-layer specification
4. Store to this directory with `[DRAFT]` status
5. Provide handoff summary
