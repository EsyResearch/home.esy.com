## Layer 1: Subject Analysis & Narrative Architecture

### Core Thesis
Burmese cuisine is the **living archive of a crossroads civilization** — a 2,000-year fermentation of Pyu preservation wisdom, Mon coastal traditions, Shan highland ingenuity, Indian spice routes, Chinese wok mastery, and Thai flavor principles, all unified by the transformative soul ingredient **ngapi** (ငါးပိ) and the uniquely Burmese **si pyan** (ဆီပြန်) technique that makes oil "return" to the cook.

### Narrative Thesis Statement
> "To eat Burmese food is to taste every empire that passed through the Irrawaddy corridor — and to discover how Burmese cooks transformed foreign ingredients into something the world had never seen."

### Chapter Schema

#### Chapter 1: The Fermented Foundation
**Metaphor**: "Ngapi — The Soul in the Jar" (ငါးပိ — အိုးထဲက ဝိညာဉ်)

**Opening Hook**: A grandmother's hands press fish into clay pots in a Rakhine village, beginning a transformation that will take six months — and define a cuisine for two millennia.

**Core Content**:
- Pyu period origins (~2nd century BCE) — earliest evidence of fish fermentation
- Ngapi varieties: nga-pi-ye (ငါးပိရည်, liquid), nga-pi-gaung (ငါးပိခေါင်း, paste), nga-pi-htaung (whole fish)
- Regional variations: Rakhine coastal (strongest), Irrawaddy delta (balanced), Shan (freshwater)
- The chemistry of controlled decay: protein breakdown, umami development, preservation
- Mon influence: proto-fermentation techniques predating Bamar arrival

**Key Figure**: **Daw Khin Nyunt** (ဒေါ်ခင်ညွန့်) — Third-generation ngapi producer in Sittwe, Rakhine State. "My grandmother said the fish must hear the morning prayers before going into the pot."

### Progress Bar Design — "The Fermentation Jar" (အချဉ်အိုး)

**Concept**: A clay fermentation pot that fills as the reader progresses. The contents visibly transform from raw ingredients at 0% to finished ngapi at 100%.

**Implementation**:
- 0%: Empty clay pot outline
- 0-15%: Raw fish visible
- 15-35%: Fish submerging in salt
- 35-60%: Color transformation (silver → amber)
- 60-85%: Darker, richer color
- 85-100%: Finished ngapi, ready for cooking

**Positioning**: Fixed right side, vertical orientation
**Size**: 120px height, 40px width
**Animation**: Liquid fills in correlation with scroll position

### Animation Principles

#### Timing
- **Reveal animations**: 600-800ms, ease-out
- **Parallax movement**: Continuous, tied to scroll
- **Transition effects**: 400-500ms, ease-in-out
- **Hover states**: 200ms

#### Signature Movements
- **Steam rise**: Subtle upward drift on food photography (CSS animation)
- **Oil shimmer**: Gentle surface movement on si pyan close-ups
- **Scroll reveals**: Content fades in from bottom with slight rise
- **Parallax depth**: 5-layer system for immersive scenes

### Parallax Depth System

| Layer | Movement Rate | Content Type |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Background | 0.2x scroll | Environment, architecture |
| Mid-ground | 0.5x scroll | Context elements, secondary figures |
| Subject | 1x scroll | Primary content, figures |
| Overlay | 1.5x scroll | Text, captions, UI elements |
| Ambient | Independent | Steam, particles, atmospheric effects |

## Layer 5: Technical Implementation Specifications

### Scroll-Lock Architecture

#### Global Scroll Behavior
- **Lock trigger**: User enters chapter viewport
- **Lock duration**: Until chapter completion or manual escape
- **Escape mechanism**: Double-tap or swipe gesture
- **Mobile adaptation**: Touch-and-hold for lock, release to continue

#### Chapter Transition Pattern
```
[Chapter N ends at 95%]
     ↓
[5% buffer zone: ambient animation only]
     ↓
[Chapter N+1 title card: 0-5%]
     ↓
[Chapter N+1 content begins: 5-100%]
```

### Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Width | Layout Adjustments |
|------------|-------|-------------------|
| Desktop | 1200px+ | Full parallax, side progress bar |
| Laptop | 992-1199px | Reduced parallax layers, side progress |
| Tablet | 768-991px | 3-layer parallax, bottom progress |
| Mobile | <768px | 2-layer parallax, minimal progress indicator |

### Performance Targets
- **Initial load**: < 3 seconds (LCP)
- **Scroll performance**: 60fps minimum
- **Image loading**: Progressive, blur-up technique
- **Total page weight**: < 8MB (aggressive lazy loading)

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Screen readers**: Full narrative text accessible
- **Reduced motion**: Static alternative available
- **Keyboard navigation**: Tab through chapters, Enter to lock
- **Color contrast**: WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1)
- **Burmese text**: Proper Unicode, screen reader pronunciation guides

### Image Requirements

#### Photography Specifications
| Type | Resolution | Format | Notes |
|------|------------|--------|-------|
| Hero/Full-width | 2400x1600 | WebP + JPEG fallback | Progressive loading |
| Figure portraits | 1200x1600 | WebP + JPEG | Face detection focus |
| Food close-ups | 1600x1200 | WebP | Color accuracy critical |
| Archival | Original quality | WebP + original | Attribution required |

#### Image Sourcing Priority
1. Original commissioned photography (food, portraits)
2. Licensed contemporary stock (scenes, markets)
3. Archival with proper attribution (historical)
4. Illustrated where photography unavailable (royal court reconstruction)

## Layer 6: Audio & Sensory Design

### Ambient Soundscape

#### Chapter-Specific Audio

| Chapter | Primary Ambient | Secondary Elements |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1: Fermented Foundation | Coastal village, waves | Morning bells, gulls |
| 2: Oil Returns | Kitchen fire, simmering | Distant conversation |
| 3: National Bowl | Pre-dawn quiet → morning bustle | Vendors calling |
| 4: Fermented Leaf | Mountain wind, tea gardens | Bird calls, rustling |
| 5: Crossroads Kitchen | Market chaos | Multiple languages |
| 6: Royal Table | Saung (Burmese harp) | Palace atmosphere |
| 7: Street Parliament | Tea shop chatter | Glass clinking, laughter |
| 8: Scattered Table | Mixed ambience | Diaspora languages |

### Music Direction
- **Instrumentation**: Saung (Burmese harp), pat waing (drum circle), hnè (oboe), bamboo flute
- **Tempo**: Slow, meditative for historical chapters; livelier for contemporary
- **Integration**: Fades with scroll, never dominates speech
- **Licensed options**: Traditional recordings with modernized production

### Voice Integration
- **Figure quotes**: Original Burmese audio with English subtitles (where possible)
- **Narration option**: Professional narrator for accessibility mode
- **Pronunciation guides**: Audio clips for Burmese terms

## Production Notes

### Cultural Sensitivity Guidelines
- Avoid positioning Burma/Myanmar as "exotic" or "undiscovered"
- Acknowledge current political context without centering it
- Present ethnic diversity as strength, not fragmentation
- Credit Burmese voices as primary authorities
- Use Burmese script authentically, not decoratively

### Language Conventions
- Country name: "Burma" for historical contexts pre-1989, "Myanmar" for contemporary
- Food names: Burmese script first, romanization in italics, English explanation
- Ethnic groups: Use preferred self-designations (e.g., "Kayin" not "Karen" unless requested)

### Archival Image Ethics
- Colonial photographs: Acknowledge photographer's colonial position
- Royal images: Note that photography was controlled by British after 1885
- Street photography: Prefer contemporary images with clear consent
