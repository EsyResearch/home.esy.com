## Phase 1: Thematic Authenticity Audit

### Color Derivation Verification

| Design Element | Claimed Source | Authentic? | Evidence |
|----------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| Crude Black (#1a202c) | Heavy crude oil | YES | Heavy crude is viscous, dark; visible at extraction sites |
| Orinoco Amber (#d69e2e) | Crude oil in light | YES | Oil ranges from black to amber; amber specific to Orinoco belt crude |
| Caribbean Navy (#1a365d) | Sea surrounding Venezuela | YES | Geographic reality; Caribbean waters |
| Refinery Steel (#4a5568) | Industrial infrastructure | YES | Gulf Coast refineries, tankers, pipelines |
| Alert Flame (#e53e3e) | Warning systems | YES | Standard industrial/crisis signaling |
| Verification colors | Information design conventions | YES | Green/amber/red widely understood for status |

**Phase 1 Status**: PASS — All colors trace to documented subject materials

## Phase 2: Novelty/Duplication Check

### Cross-Essay Color Collision Analysis

| Essay | Primary Colors | Collision Risk? |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Diamond Cartel** | Carbon black (#0D0D0D), terracotta red, sepia, crimson | LOW — Different black shade; no amber/oil gradient |
| **Semiconductor Story** | Silicon gray, gold, copper, cleanroom white, ultraviolet | NONE — Completely different palette |
| **Rwanda Genocide** | Deep red, memorial gray, mourning tones | LOW — Red is alert accent only, not memorial |
| **Khmer Rouge** | Archive sepia, documentary desaturation | LOW — Different era treatment approach |
| **Scramble for Africa** | Colonial khaki, African earth tones | LOW — Venezuela uses Caribbean sea, not savanna |
| **Gods of Africa** | Earth tones, spiritual gold | LOW — Amber is industrial oil, not spiritual |

**Unique Identifiers Confirmed**:
1. **Oil gradient (black-to-amber)** — Not used in any existing essay
2. **Pipeline gauge progress bar** — Unique to this essay
3. **Verification badge system** — Novel information design
4. **Diplomatic map layer toggle** — Specific to geopolitical content
5. **Industrial steel palette** — Not used elsewhere

**Phase 2 Status**: PASS — No significant cross-essay collisions

## Phase 3: CSS Implementation Audit

### Design Tokens Verification

| Token | Design Research | Ready for CSS? |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|

| `--color-orinoco-amber` | #d69e2e | YES |
| `--color-caribbean-navy` | #1a365d | YES |

| `--transition-fast` | 150ms | YES |
| `--transition-medium` | 300ms | YES |
| `--transition-slow` | 500ms | YES |

### Typography Verification

| Category | Design Research | Justified by Subject? |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Headlines (Inter Bold) | Clarity, authority | YES — Serious geopolitical content requires clear, authoritative type |
| Body (Source Serif Pro) | Readability, authority | YES — Long-form systems explanation benefits from serif readability |
| Mono (JetBrains Mono) | Data, legal text | YES — Technical/legal content needs monospace distinction |

### Animation Philosophy Verification

| Principle | Design Research | Appropriate for Subject? |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Calm authority | Subtle, revealing, respectful | YES — Breaking news requires calm, not spectacle |
| Minimal scroll-lock | 3-4 sequences max | YES — Systems content is explanatory, not theatrical |
| Smooth transitions | 300-500ms ease-out | YES — Professional, not jarring |

**Phase 3 Status**: PASS — Design tokens ready for CSS implementation

## Reconciliation Summary

| Phase | Criterion | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Thematic Authenticity | PASS |
| 2 | Novelty/Duplication | PASS |
| 3 | CSS Implementation | PASS |

### Blocking Conditions

- [x] Design derived from subject matter (not copied from other essays)
- [x] No color/typography collision with existing essays
- [x] CSS tokens properly defined for implementation
- [x] Animation philosophy appropriate for content sensitivity

### Non-Blocking Notes

- Consider adding subtle oil texture overlay for background depth
- Verification badge system should be documented in a reusable pattern guide for future essays with similar needs
- Diplomatic map layer toggle pattern could be extracted for reuse
