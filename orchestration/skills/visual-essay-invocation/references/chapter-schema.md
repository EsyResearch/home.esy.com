## Component Guidelines

### Chapter Title

Format: `Chapter N: [Title]`

The title should be:
- Evocative, not merely descriptive
- 2-6 words
- Hint at the chapter's emotional center

**Strong titles:**
- "The First Winter" (evokes cold, hardship)
- "The Believers" (suggests faith against odds)
- "Now I Am Become Death" (quotes, gravitas)
- "The Flash That Changed Everything" (pivotal moment)

**Weak titles:**
- "The 1970s" (merely temporal)
- "Important Scientists" (generic)
- "Part Three" (no meaning)
- "Technical Development" (dry, abstract)

### Temporal/Contextual Marker

The italicized line beneath the title provides grounding:

**Temporal markers:**
- *1956* (year alone)
- *December 2, 1942 — Chicago, Illinois* (date and place)
- *1943-1945 — Los Alamos, New Mexico* (range and place)
- *The 1980s* (decade)

**Contextual markers:**
- *The Scientists of Site Y* (thematic grouping)
- *From Myth to Mathematics* (conceptual journey)
- *The Questions That Remain* (open-ended)

### Metaphor Line

The most critical single line in each chapter. Must be:
- One sentence, ideally under 15 words
- Concrete imagery for abstract concept
- Memorable and quotable
- Honest to the content

**Strong metaphors:**

| Chapter Content | Metaphor |
|-----------------|----------|
| Funding collapse | "The ice age of ideas" |
| Nuclear test | "Prometheus unbound" |
| Ignored researchers | "The monks who preserved knowledge through the dark ages" |
| Market bubble | "A false dawn—warmth before the next freeze" |
| Technological breakthrough | "The shot heard round the world" |
| Moral reckoning | "Prometheus chained" |

**Weak metaphors:**
- "An important development" (not a metaphor)
- "Things changed significantly" (no imagery)
- "The beginning of something new" (generic)

### Central Visuals

List 3-6 specific visual assets with enough detail for sourcing:

**Good specificity:**
```
- The Enola Gay on Tinian Island, being prepared for mission
- Colonel Paul Tibbets waving from the cockpit before takeoff
- Hiroshima aerial reconnaissance photograph, pre-bombing
- The mushroom cloud over Hiroshima, taken from observation aircraft
- Ground-level destruction photograph, Hiroshima city center
- The human shadow burned into the Sumitomo Bank steps
```

**Poor specificity:**
```
- A photo of the plane
- Some pictures of destruction
- Images from the bombing
```

### Content Focus

Write 3-5 paragraphs covering:

1. **Setup**: What's happening, when, where, who's involved
2. **Action**: Key events, decisions, developments
3. **Stakes**: Why this matters, what's at risk
4. **Significance**: How this connects to the broader narrative
5. **Bridge**: Transition toward the next chapter

**Tone guidelines:**
- Present tense for immediacy where appropriate
- Specific details over generalizations
- Human moments alongside historical facts
- Emotional honesty—don't flatten the drama

### Key Figure Profiles

Every visual essay needs human anchors. Each profile follows this structure:

```
**[Full Name]** — [Epithet]
- [Achievement 1]
- [Achievement 2]
- [Achievement 3]
- "[Defining quote]"
- Photograph: [Description]
```

**Epithet guidelines:**
- 3-6 words
- Captures their role in this specific story
- Can be poetic: "The Prophet Who Saw Too Soon"
- Can be descriptive: "The Father of Information Theory"

**Achievement guidelines:**
- Use active verbs: "Created," "Founded," "Invented," "Led"
- Be specific: "Broke the Enigma code" not "worked on cryptography"
- Include dates when significant
- Include context: "at age 38" or "despite opposition"

**Quote selection:**
- Actual documented quotes only—no paraphrasing
- Choose quotes that reveal character or capture moment
- Shorter is usually better (under 20 words ideal)
- Include context if needed: "When asked about regret, he replied..."

**Photograph description:**
- Setting: "at a blackboard," "in the laboratory," "at Congressional hearing"
- Era: "1954," "during the war years," "in his final years"
- Emotional quality: "confident," "haunted," "triumphant"
- Specific elements: "trademark porkpie hat," "cigarette in hand"

### Scroll-Lock Sequence

Every chapter needs at least one named scroll-lock sequence.

**Naming:**
Names should be evocative and hint at the experience:
- "The Freeze" (funding collapse visualization)
- "The First Light" (nuclear test revelation)
- "The Collapse" (error rate graph plummeting)
- "The Pile Goes Critical" (nuclear reactor achieving criticality)
- "The Hearing" (portrait gallery of trial)

**Choreography format:**
```
- **0-25% scroll:** [State A description]
- **25-50% scroll:** [Transition description]
- **50-75% scroll:** [State B description]
- **75-100% scroll:** [Resolution description]
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use specific percentages (not "middle" or "near the end")
- Describe visual states, not implementation details
- Each stage should have clear purpose
- Total should feel like complete mini-narrative

### Parallax Treatment

Describe how depth is created in key visuals:

```
**Parallax Treatment:**
Layer the mushroom cloud photograph with foreground desert brush
silhouettes (1.2x scroll speed), the cloud itself as primary subject
(1x), distant mountains behind (0.7x), and atmospheric dust particles
floating in overlay (1.5x, randomized drift).
```

**Include:**
- Which elements are separated into layers
- Relative scroll speeds (1x = normal, <1 = slower, >1 = faster)
- Any additional effects (blur, opacity shifts)

---

## Chapter Flow Patterns

### Opening Chapters (1-2)

Set the stage:
- Establish the central question or tension
- Introduce the world before the main action
- Often slower pacing, more context-building
- Metaphors tend toward setup: "Before the storm," "The dream begins"

### Rising Action Chapters (3-N-2)

Build complexity:
- Introduce key figures and their contributions
- Escalate stakes and tension
- Faster pacing, more events per chapter
- Metaphors show progression: "The race begins," "The pieces assemble"

### Climax Chapter

The pivotal moment:
- Most dramatic scroll-lock sequences
- Often the most famous images/events
- Can be shorter—density over length
- Metaphor captures the turn: "The flash that changed everything"

### Falling Action Chapters

Explore consequences:
- What happened after the climax
- How the world changed
- Human costs and reckonings
- Metaphors show aftermath: "The reckoning," "The inheritance"

### Final Chapter

Resolution or open question:
- Bring narrative to present day
- Reflect on significance
- Often returns to opening question with new depth
- Metaphor can be cyclical or forward-looking

## Example Chapters

### Example 1: Historical Event

```markdown
### Chapter 5: Trinity
*July 16, 1945 — 5:29:45 AM*

**Metaphor:** Prometheus unbound—the fire that couldn't be returned

**Central Visuals:**
- The Trinity tower with the Gadget hoisted, night before test
- Berlyn Brixner's fireball sequence photographs, millisecond intervals
- The mushroom cloud at full development
- Oppenheimer and Groves inspecting Ground Zero aftermath
- The crater and trinitite glass formation
- Observation bunker silhouettes against the cloud

**Content Focus:**
They built observation bunkers 10,000 yards from the tower. They placed
bets on the yield—Oppenheimer guessed low. Fermi calculated whether the
bomb might ignite the atmosphere. At 5:29:45 AM, the desert became
brighter than the sun.

[Continue with 2-3 more paragraphs]

**Key Figure Profile:**

**Kenneth Bainbridge** — The Man Who Directed Doomsday
- Supervised all Trinity test preparations
- Chose the test site in New Mexico desert
- Coordinated 400 personnel on test day
- First words after detonation, to Oppenheimer: "Now we are all sons of bitches"
- Photograph: Bainbridge at the test site, clipboard in hand, weight of responsibility visible

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: "The First Light"**

The defining sequence of the essay—the moment humanity split the atom
in anger.

- **0-20% scroll:** The tower at night. Stillness. Countdown clock in corner.
- **20-30% scroll:** Screen goes pure white. Hold. Let users feel the blindness.
- **30-50% scroll:** Fireball photographs appear in sequence—the expanding sphere, millisecond by millisecond.
- **50-70% scroll:** Transition to mushroom cloud formation, rising.
- **70-85% scroll:** Pull back to show observation bunker silhouettes against cloud.
- **85-100% scroll:** Cut to Oppenheimer's face. His words type out.

**Parallax Treatment:**
The mushroom cloud photograph layered with foreground desert brush (1.3x),
primary cloud mass (1x), distant Jemez Mountains (0.6x), atmospheric dust
particles drifting (ambient layer, randomized).
```

### Example 2: Concept/Era Chapter

```markdown
### Chapter 4: The First Winter
*1973-1980*

**Metaphor:** The ice age of ideas

**Central Visuals:**
- Empty MIT AI Lab corridors
- The Lighthill Report cover page
- Headlines from Nature and Science declaring AI failed
- Funding graphs showing cliff-edge decline
- Researchers photographed leaving academia for industry

**Content Focus:**
Reality arrived like a cold front. The Lighthill Report in Britain declared
AI had failed to achieve its "grandiose objectives." DARPA slashed funding.
The promises of 1956 looked like hubris.

The fundamental problem: early AI could handle toy problems but collapsed
on real-world complexity. Symbolic logic couldn't scale. Neural networks
hit mathematical walls. The dream froze.

Those who remained learned caution. The word "AI" itself became toxic in
grant proposals. Researchers rebranded their work as anything else.

**Key Figure Profile:**

**James Lighthill** — The Man Who Froze the Dream
- British applied mathematician
- Commissioned by UK Science Research Council to evaluate AI
- His 1973 report devastated British AI funding
- Declared: "In no part of the field have discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised"
- Photograph: Lighthill in academic robes, the authority who pronounced judgment

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: "The Freeze"**

A funding graph becomes a death warrant for a generation of research.

- **0-30% scroll:** Funding line rises through the optimistic 1960s
- **30-50% scroll:** The line plateaus, wobbles
- **50-70% scroll:** Sharp decline begins, headlines stack alongside
- **70-90% scroll:** Line reaches bottom, flatlines
- **90-100% scroll:** Color grade shifts cold—blues and grays wash over the frame

**Visual Treatment:**
Cold color grading throughout—desaturated blues, gray tones. Photographs
appear frost-edged with subtle vignetting. The visual temperature drops.
```

## Common Mistakes

### Metaphor Failures
- **Missing entirely**: Every chapter must have one
- **Too abstract**: "A significant change" isn't a metaphor
- **Too complex**: Should be graspable in one read
- **Mixing metaphors**: One metaphor per chapter

### Profile Failures
- **No photograph description**: Implementation needs this
- **Vague achievements**: "Contributed to the field"
- **Invented quotes**: Only use documented words
- **Missing epithets**: Name alone isn't enough

### Scroll-Lock Failures
- **No percentages**: "The image appears" isn't choreography
- **Too vague**: Implementation needs specific states
- **No name**: Every sequence needs an evocative title
- **Purpose unclear**: What should the user feel/understand?

### Content Focus Failures
- **Too short**: 3-5 paragraphs minimum
- **Too encyclopedic**: Tell a story, not a Wikipedia summary
- **No stakes**: Why does this moment matter?
- **No transition**: How does this lead to next chapter?
