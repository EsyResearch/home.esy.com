## Visual Medium Matching

### Use Photorealistic Treatment When:
- Subject is historical with rich archives
- Human stories are central
- Documentary credibility matters
- Era-spanning narrative benefits from visual time markers

**Best archives:**
- Library of Congress
- National Archives (US, UK, others)
- Getty Historical
- Magnum Photos
- AP/Reuters Archives
- University special collections
- Presidential libraries
- Scientific institution archives (NASA, CERN, etc.)

### Use Illustrated Treatment When:
- Subject is abstract or microscopic
- Processes need visualization (not documentation)
- Metaphor is more powerful than photography
- Future-focused or speculative elements

### Use Mixed Treatment When:
- Historical context meets technical explanation
- People and concepts both need representation
- Clear separation between modes is possible

## Search Interest Validation

Before committing to a topic, validate interest:

### Tools
- Google Trends (compare topics)
- Answer the Public (question patterns)
- SEMrush/Ahrefs (keyword volume)
- Reddit/Quora (question frequency)
- Wikipedia traffic stats

### Signals of Strong Interest
- Consistent baseline search volume
- Spikes correlating with news events
- "How does X work" query patterns
- "History of X" query patterns
- Educational course demand
- Book/documentary market activity

### Red Flags
- Search interest only during narrow news windows
- Declining trend over multiple years
- Very niche audience (unless intentional)
- Topic already exhaustively covered in existing formats

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

### Topics That Seem Good But Aren't

**Too broad:** "The History of Science"
- No clear arc, infinite scope
- Better: Pick a specific discovery or era

**Too narrow:** "The 1987 Supernova"
- Not enough narrative complexity
- Better: "How Stars Die" (broader, more resonant)

**Too abstract without anchors:** "The Philosophy of Mind"
- No human faces, no visual hooks
- Better: "The Scientists Searching for Consciousness"

**Too recent:** "The 2024 Election"
- No historical perspective yet
- Better: Wait or frame as "How We Got Here"

### Topics That Seem Risky But Work

**Controversial with clear facts:** Israel-Palestine
- High interest, underserved by fair explainers
- Requires extreme care but rewards depth

**Technical and boring-sounding:** The Federal Reserve
- Massive search interest, poorly explained elsewhere
- Benefits enormously from visualization

**Depressing:** Cancer, Climate Change
- High stakes create engagement
- Requires hope or agency element

## Topic Expansion Prompts

When developing a topic, ask:

1. What's the central question this essay answers?
2. Who are the 5-10 key figures with available photography?
3. What's the pivotal moment (the climax)?
4. What transformation will the reader experience?
5. Why does this matter right now?
6. What's the visual hook for the hero section?
7. What metaphors make the abstract concrete?
8. What's been poorly explained by existing content?
