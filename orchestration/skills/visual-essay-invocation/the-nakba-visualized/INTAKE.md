## 1. Topic Definition

### Core Subject
The Nakba (Arabic: النكبة, "the catastrophe") — the displacement of approximately 700,000+ Palestinian Arabs during the 1947–1949 Palestine war, the depopulation of hundreds of villages and urban neighborhoods, and the creation of a multi-generational refugee population.

### Scope Boundaries

| Included | Excluded |
|----------|----------|
| 1947–1949 primary focus (displacement events) | Post-1967 events (separate topic) |
| Background context: 1917–1947 (Mandate era) | Detailed military history (this is not a war essay) |
| Aftermath: refugee institutions, UNRWA, camps | Contemporary politics and conflict (post-1950) |
| Memory, oral history, cultural preservation | Advocacy or political prescription |
| Multiple perspectives and contested narratives | Polemics or propaganda framing |

### Key Questions to Answer (10 Core Questions)

1. **What does "Nakba" mean?** — Definition, etymology, when the term became widely used
2. **What was Palestinian society like before 1948?** — Cities, villages, culture, economy, institutions
3. **What happened between 1947 and 1949?** — Major phases and turning points
4. **How many people were displaced?** — Estimate ranges and why they vary
5. **What caused people to leave?** — Combat, expulsions, fear, strategy, collapse — how do historians weigh these?
6. **What happened to depopulated villages afterward?** — Landscape transformation
7. **What was the international response?** — UN partition, armistices, UNRWA
8. **How did refugeehood become multi-generational?** — Institutions, camps, legal status
9. **What are the biggest myths/misconceptions on all sides?** — Evidence-based corrections
10. **What is still unknown?** — Open questions, archive limitations, contested interpretations

## 2. Audience Definition

### Primary Audience
**Curious general readers + advanced high school/college learners**

| Goals | Understand what happened, why it matters, how we know |
| Concerns | Fairness, accuracy, not being propagandized |
| Reading Ability | Capable of nuance; do not dumb down |

### Secondary Audience
- Educators seeking teaching resources
- Researchers looking for visual data representations
- Diaspora communities seeking accessible historical framing

## 3. Visual Treatment Philosophy

### Treatment Type: Photorealistic (Archival/Documentary)

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| Primary Medium | Historical photography, archival maps, documents |
| Era Processing | B&W for pre-1948 and 1948 events; sepia for Mandate-era documents |
| Supplementary | Original vector diagrams, maps, timelines (NOT mixed with photos) |
| Reconstructions | Allowed ONLY when clearly labeled "Artist's reconstruction" |
| Prohibited | Graphic imagery, humiliation, sensationalism |

### Licensing-Safe Source Strategy

| Source Type | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Mandate-era map sheets (Palestine Open Maps) | ✅ Public Domain | Side-by-side past/present |
| National Library of Israel ("Any Use Permitted") | ✅ Verify per-file | Country caution noted |
| Wikimedia Commons (CC BY / CC BY-SA / PD) | ✅ Verify each file | Check license explicitly |
| USGS Landsat satellite imagery | ✅ Public Domain | "Now" layer for sliders |
| Natural Earth vectors | ✅ Public Domain | Base map vectors |
| UN photos | ⚠️ Verify | Often have restrictions |
| Getty/AP/Reuters | ❌ Avoid | Require paid license |
| Contemporary designer tatreez patterns | ❌ Avoid | Copyright protected |

### Reconstruction Policy
- AI-generated or illustrated reconstructions: **ONLY when clearly labeled**
- Label format: "Artist's reconstruction (not a photograph)"
- Reconstruction notes panel required: what is grounded vs. artistic inference
- Never present reconstructions as documentary photography

## 5. Non-Negotiable Constraints

### Editorial Standards (High-Sensitivity Topic)

| Principle | Implementation |

| Fact vs. interpretation | Separate established facts from scholarly interpretation |
| Multiple narratives | Acknowledge "War of Independence" vs. "Nakba" framing |
| Trauma-aware | No graphic detail; content warnings for violence sections |
| No hate | Distinguish governments, armed groups, civilians, time periods |

### Red Lines
- ❌ No pseudo-history — only academic/peer-reviewed sources
- ❌ No sensationalism or humiliation
- ❌ No disputed claims presented as settled fact
- ❌ No blanket blame of entire peoples
- ❌ No copyright-risky imagery
