## Purpose

This document identifies what we DON'T know with certainty and what CANNOT be claimed in the essay. Epistemic humility is essential for a high-sensitivity historical topic.

---

## Gap Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Numerical** | Figures that exist as ranges, not points |
| **Causal** | Interpretive disputes about why events occurred |
| **Evidentiary** | Gaps in documentation or archive access |
| **Visual** | Missing imagery for key events/figures |
| **Attribution** | Quotes or statements not fully verified |

---

## 1. Numerical Gaps

### 1.1 Displacement Total

| Estimate | Source |
|----------|--------|
| ~520,000 (low) | Various |
| ~700,000 (consensus) | UN 1949–50 estimate |
| ~750,000–800,000 | Higher estimates |
| ~900,000–1,000,000 | Arab states' claims |

**RULE**: Always present as a RANGE, not a single number.
**Suggested phrasing**: "Estimates range from about 520,000 to over 900,000, with general consensus exceeding 700,000."

### 1.2 Depopulated Villages

| Estimate | Source |
|----------|--------|
| 400–418 | Walid Khalidi, *All That Remains* |
| 350–400 | Other sources |

**RULE**: Use "over 400" or "approximately 400" with citation to Khalidi.

### 1.3 Deir Yassin Casualties

| Estimate | Source |
|----------|--------|
| ~100–107 | Later historical consensus |
| ~150–254 | Early reports (UK delegation, Red Cross) |

**RULE**: Present the range; explain why estimates differ (initial reports vs. later investigation).

### 1.4 Lydda/Ramle Population

| Estimate | Source |
|----------|--------|
| 50,000–70,000 | Morris, various |

**RULE**: Use range; note this includes refugees from Jaffa already present.

---

## 2. Causal Gaps (Interpretive Disputes)

### 2.1 "Master Plan" Debate

| Position | Historian |
|----------|-----------|
| No master plan, but significant expulsions | Benny Morris |
| Systematic ethnic cleansing by design | Ilan Pappé |

**RULE**: Present both interpretations with attribution. Do NOT assert one as settled fact.
**Suggested phrasing**: "Historians disagree on whether there was a coordinated master plan. Morris argues... Pappé contends..."

### 2.2 Causes of Flight (Village Level)

| Cause Category | Occurrence |
|----------------|------------|
| Direct expulsion | Documented in some cases (Lydda, Ramle) |
| Fear of attack | Widespread after Deir Yassin |
| Combat/evacuation | During military operations |
| Collapse of services | Economic/social breakdown |
| Arab leadership instructions | Disputed; most historians dismiss as primary cause |

**RULE**: Use multi-causal model. Avoid presenting single-cause explanations.
**Morris's analysis**: "The most important single factor in the exodus of April–June was Jewish attack."

### 2.3 Plan Dalet Intent

| Interpretation |
|----------------|
| Defensive plan to secure territory |
| Blueprint for population expulsion |
| Somewhere in between |

**RULE**: Present as debated; do not assert one interpretation.

### 2.4 Arab Leadership Instructions

| Historical Position |
|---------------------|
| Early Israeli claims: Arabs told to leave |
| New Historians: No evidence of mass instructions |
| Morris: "Almost invariably no primary sources were cited" for the claim |

**RULE**: Note that this claim has been largely dismissed by historians; explain the evidence gap.

---

## 3. Evidentiary Gaps

### 3.1 Classified Archives

| Archive | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Israeli military archives (some files) | Classified; includes Deir Yassin material |
| British intelligence files | Partially classified |
| Arab state archives | Limited access |

**RULE**: Acknowledge archive limitations; note that new evidence could change interpretations.

### 3.2 Oral History Limitations

| Challenge | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| Memory reliability | Individual accounts need triangulation |
| Survivor bias | Some experiences not documented |
| Recording gaps | Many testimonies not collected until decades later |

**RULE**: Use oral history as evidence but note methodology. See Chapter 10 for explanation of triangulation.

### 3.3 Documentation Gaps by Locality

| Locality Type | Documentation Level |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Major cities (Haifa, Jaffa) | Better documented |
| Small villages | Often poorly documented |
| Bedouin communities | Least documented |

**RULE**: Be cautious about generalizing from well-documented cases to less-documented ones.

---

## 4. Visual/Imagery Gaps

### 4.1 Events Without Reliable Photography

| Event | Photography Status |
|-------|-------------------|
| Deir Yassin massacre | Very limited; mostly aftermath |
| Lydda/Ramle expulsion march | Limited or unverified |
| Village depopulations (most) | No photography available |
| Pre-1948 village life (many) | Varies by village |

**RULE**: Use maps and diagrams where photography unavailable. Label clearly as "reconstruction" or "diagram."

### 4.2 Figure Photography Gaps

| Figure | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Constantin Zurayk | Portrait needs verification |
| Many Palestinian civilians | Named individuals with photos rare |
| Rural village leaders | Limited documentation |

**RULE**: For figures without verified photography, use text-based profiles or clearly labeled silhouettes.

---

## 5. Attribution Gaps

### 5.1 Quotes Needing Verification

| Quote | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Ben-Gurion "drive them out" gesture | Reported by Rabin; gesture interpretation |
| Exact Bernadotte quote on refugee camp | Paraphrased in secondary sources |
| Some oral history quotes | Need consent/provenance verification |

**RULE**: Quotes marked ⚠️ in QUOTES.md need additional verification before publication.

### 5.2 Disputed Attributions

| Claim | Issue |
|-------|-------|
| Arab radio broadcasts urging evacuation | Historians largely dismiss; primary sources lacking |
| Specific orders from Ben-Gurion | Some documented (Lydda); others interpreted |

---

## 6. Conceptual Gaps

### 6.1 "Nakba" Definition Boundaries

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Does Nakba include events before 1948? | Some scholars include Mandate era |
| Does Nakba end in 1949? | Ongoing displacement and dispossession |
| Is Nakba only about displacement? | Also includes cultural, economic, social destruction |

**RULE**: Define scope clearly in Prologue. Acknowledge broader interpretations exist.

### 6.2 Terminology Contestation

| Term | Issue |
|------|-------|
| "Ethnic cleansing" | Morris uses the term but some contest |
| "War of Independence" vs. "Nakba" | Same events, different frames |
| "Refugees" vs. "expelled" | Language carries interpretation |

**RULE**: Use precision language. Acknowledge contested terminology in Chapter 2.

---

## 7. Claims NOT to Make

### Absolute Prohibitions

| ❌ DO NOT CLAIM | INSTEAD SAY |
|-----------------|-------------|
| "Exactly X people were displaced" | "Estimates range from X to Y" |
| "The Nakba was a planned genocide" | "Historians debate the degree of central planning" |
| "Arabs left because their leaders told them to" | "This claim is not supported by documentary evidence" |
| "All villages were militarily attacked" | "Causes varied by locality" |
| "There was no Zionist violence" | "Violence is documented from multiple parties" |
| "All displacement was voluntary" | "Evidence shows a range of causes including expulsion" |

### Statements Requiring Qualification

| Claim | Required Qualification |
|-------|------------------------|
| Population figures | "Estimated" / "approximately" |
| Cause of specific displacement | "Evidence suggests" / "according to [source]" |
| Intent of military operations | "Historians interpret this as" / "Morris argues" |
| Quotes not directly sourced | "reportedly said" / "according to [intermediary]" |

---

## 8. Open Research Questions

### For "What We Still Don't Know" (Chapter 11)

1. **What would newly declassified Israeli archives reveal?**
   - Material on Deir Yassin remains classified
   - Additional operational orders may exist

2. **What oral history remains uncollected?**
   - Elderly survivors dying
   - Some communities never systematically documented

3. **How do we weigh competing evidence?**
   - When documents and testimony conflict
   - When historians disagree on interpretation

4. **What evidence would change the consensus?**
   - Discovery of explicit expulsion master plan
   - Discovery of widespread Arab broadcast instructions
   - Neither has been found
