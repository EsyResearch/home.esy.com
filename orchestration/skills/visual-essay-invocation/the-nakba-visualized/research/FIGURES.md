> — *Ma'na an-Nakba* (1948)

**Secondary Quote**:
> "Seven Arab states declare war on Zionism in Palestine, stop impotent before it, and turn on their heels. The representatives of the Arabs deliver fiery speeches in the highest international forums... Declarations fall like bombs from the mouths of officials at the meetings of the Arab League, but when action becomes necessary, the fire is still and quiet and steel and iron are rusted and twisted, quick to bend and disintegrate."
> — *Ma'na an-Nakba* (1948)

**Legacy**:
