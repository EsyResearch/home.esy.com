## Case Study Strategy

Chapter 7 presents "Six Places, Six Different Stories" to demonstrate that the Nakba was not a single script but varied significantly by locality. This approach:
- Avoids over-generalization
- Shows urban/rural variation
- Includes different causes of displacement
- Provides concrete human stories
- Enables before/after map visualization
