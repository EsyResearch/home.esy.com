## Era Overview

This essay spans approximately 35 years of history (1917–1950), with distinct visual and emotional registers for each period. The era guide defines how visual treatment shifts to communicate temporal and tonal changes.

| Era | Period | Mood | Visual Character |
|-----|--------|------|------------------|
| **Ottoman Twilight** | Pre-1920 | Continuity disrupted | Sepia warmth, aged patina |
| **Mandate Years** | 1920–1947 | Rising tension | B&W with warmth, documentary grain |
| **Catastrophe** | 1947–1949 | Rupture, trauma | High-contrast B&W, harsh light |
| **Aftermath** | 1949–1950+ | Displacement, waiting | Desaturated, dust, tent fabric |

---

## Era 1: Ottoman Twilight (Pre-1920)

### Temporal Scope
- Late Ottoman period through WWI
- British military administration (1917–1920)

### Historical Context
- End of 400 years of Ottoman rule

### Visual Treatment

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| **Color** | Sepia tones, parchment-like warmth |
| **Grain** | Heavy film grain, aged paper texture |
| **Contrast** | Soft, muted contrast |
| **Edges** | Vignetting, faded borders |
| **Typography** | Serif with Ottoman/classical inflection |

### Mood
- **Distant past** — not within living memory for most readers
- **World-before** — establishing what existed before disruption
- **Documentary distance** — archival quality

### Asset Types
- Matson Collection early photographs
- Ottoman-era maps and documents
- Balfour Declaration original

---

## Era 2: Mandate Years (1920–1947)

### Temporal Scope
- Formal British Mandate (1923–1948)
- Herbert Samuel through Alan Cunningham
- 1936–39 Arab Revolt
- WWII and Holocaust aftermath
- UNSCOP and lead-up to partition

### Historical Context
- British administration establishing structures
- Jewish immigration waves (aliyot)
- Arab resistance and revolt
- Growing intercommunal tension
- International attention post-WWII

### Visual Treatment

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| **Color** | Black & white with warm undertones |
| **Grain** | Moderate documentary grain |
| **Contrast** | Natural, journalistic contrast |
| **Light** | Mediterranean sun, clear shadows |
| **Typography** | Clean serif headlines, readable body |

### Mood
- **Documentary realism** — this is recorded history
- **Building tension** — sense of approaching crisis
- **Living society** — vibrant, functioning communities

### Asset Types
- Matson Collection 1920s–1940s (bulk of collection)
- British Mandate documents
- Mandate-era map sheets (Palestine Open Maps)
- UN committee photographs

### Sub-Phases

| Period | Focus | Tone Shift |
|--------|-------|------------|
| 1920–1929 | Early Mandate, establishment | Relative stability |
| 1929–1935 | Rising tensions | First major violence |
| 1936–1939 | Arab Revolt | Rebellion and suppression |
| 1940–1945 | WWII years | Background tension, Holocaust |
| 1945–1947 | Post-war crisis | Escalation, UNSCOP |

## Era 3: Catastrophe (November 1947 – December 1949)

### Temporal Scope
- Partition vote (November 29, 1947)
- Civil war phase (Nov 1947 – May 1948)
- Interstate war (May 1948 – armistices)
- Displacement events throughout

### Historical Context
- UN partition vote triggers violence
- Urban evacuations: Haifa, Jaffa
- Village depopulations
- Deir Yassin and its aftermath
- Declaration of Israeli independence
- Arab armies enter
- Lydda/Ramle expulsion
- Bernadotte assassination
- UNGA 194

### Visual Treatment

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| **Color** | Pure black & white, no warmth |
| **Grain** | Heavy, urgent grain |
| **Contrast** | High contrast, harsh light/shadow |
| **Light** | Stark, unforgiving |
| **Motion** | Implied movement, blur suggestion |
| **Typography** | Bold, impactful headlines |

### Mood
- **Rupture** — the break in continuity
- **Urgency** — events moving fast
- **Trauma** — without sensationalism
- **Documentary rawness** — unfiltered reality

### Asset Types
- Limited 1948 photography (verify sources carefully)
- Map overlays showing displacement
- Document scans (resolutions, orders)
- Red Cross documentation
- UN mediator reports

### Content Sensitivity

**CRITICAL**: This era requires trauma-aware presentation:
- No graphic imagery of violence or bodies
- No humiliation of victims
- Focus on evidence and human dignity
- Content warnings before massacre discussions
- Avoid sensationalism

## Era 4: Aftermath (1949–1950+)

### Temporal Scope
- Armistice agreements (1949)
- UNRWA establishment (December 1949)
- Early refugee camp period
- First years of displacement

### Historical Context
- "Green Line" established
- Refugee population settles into camps
- UNRWA begins operations
- No peace treaties; status becomes permanent
- Beginning of multi-generational displacement

### Visual Treatment

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| **Color** | Desaturated, dust tones, earth |
| **Grain** | Moderate, documentary |
| **Contrast** | Flattened, washed out |
| **Texture** | Canvas, tent fabric, dust |
| **Light** | Harsh sun, inadequate shelter |
| **Typography** | Utilitarian, institutional |

### Mood
- **Waiting** — temporary becomes permanent
- **Displacement** — out of place, out of home
- **Endurance** — sumud (steadfastness)
- **Institutionalization** — ration cards, camp life

### Asset Types
- Early UNRWA photographs (verify permissions)
- Refugee camp documentation
- Armistice documents
- UNGA 302 text

## Transition Treatments

### Between Eras

| Transition | Visual Technique |
|------------|------------------|
| Ottoman → Mandate | Fade from sepia to B&W |
| Mandate → Catastrophe | Increase contrast, remove warmth |
| Catastrophe → Aftermath | Desaturate, add dust/texture |

### Chapter Boundaries
Each chapter crossing an era boundary should acknowledge the temporal shift through:
- Background color/texture transition
- Typography weight adjustment
- Visual processing shift

---

## Typography by Era

| Era | Headline | Body | Accent |
|-----|----------|------|--------|
| Ottoman | Decorative serif | Classical serif | Calligraphic |
| Mandate | Strong serif | Clean serif | Documentary |
| Catastrophe | Bold sans/serif | Readable body | Urgent |
| Aftermath | Institutional | Functional | UNRWA-style |

---

## Color Palette Integration

The era guide interacts with the design system color palette:

| Era | Primary Background | Text | Accent |
|-----|-------------------|------|--------|
| Ottoman | Parchment warm | Dark brown | Gold/sepia |
| Mandate | Cream/warm gray | Near-black | Olive |
| Catastrophe | Pure white/black | High contrast | Red (sparingly) |
| Aftermath | Dust/tan | Dark gray | Sea-glass (hope) |

## Implementation Notes

### For Design Researcher (Gate 4)
- Develop specific CSS variables for each era
- Create transition animations between eras
- Design era indicator for progress bar

### For Scrollytelling Expert (Gate 5)
- Apply era treatments consistently within chapters
- Handle transitions at chapter boundaries
- Maintain accessibility across all treatments

### For Image Research Expert (Gate 4.5)
- Source images appropriate to each era
- Apply era-appropriate processing in documentation
- Note when images don't match era (explain context)
