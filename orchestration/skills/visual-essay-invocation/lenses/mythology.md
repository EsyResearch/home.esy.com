# Mythology

Specialized guidance for visual essays covering mythology, religious narratives, and sacred traditions. Use alongside the core invocation template.

## When to Use This Reference

Apply mythological treatment when the subject is:
- Sacred narratives (epics, creation myths, divine stories)
- Religious figures (gods, avatars, saints, prophets)
- Cosmological concepts (cycles of time, realms, cosmic forces)
- Symbolic/allegorical traditions (not historical events)

## Core Differences from Documentary Treatment

| Aspect | Documentary | Mythological |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Truth claim | "This happened" | "This is told" / "This means" |
| Time | Linear, dated | Cyclical, eternal, non-linear |
| Figures | Historical persons | Divine beings, archetypes |
| Sources | Archives, photography | Art, sculpture, manuscripts, illustration |
| Narrator stance | Reporter | Storyteller |

## Visual Source Hierarchy

### Primary: Photography of Historical Art

The visual tradition IS the content. Prioritize:

**Sculpture**
- Temple carvings (Khajuraho, Ellora, Angkor Wat, Mahabalipuram)
- Bronze statues (Chola bronzes, Pala sculpture)
- Stone reliefs (narrative panels, processional friezes)

**Painting**
- Miniature traditions (Pahari, Rajasthani, Mughal, Tanjore)
- Manuscript illustrations (palm leaf, paper)
- Mural paintings (Ajanta, Kerala murals)

**Manuscripts**
- Illuminated texts
- Palm leaf manuscripts
- Calligraphic traditions

### Secondary: Custom Illustration

Use when:
- No historical visual exists for a concept
- Cosmic scale requires abstraction
- Animation/transformation sequences need consistency
- Historical art lacks clarity for modern viewers

Custom illustration should:
- Reference historical styles (not generic fantasy)
- Maintain consistent visual language throughout essay
- Be clearly distinguished from historical sources
- Credit the illustrator

### Tertiary: Contemporary Devotional Art

Use sparingly:
- Calendar art, bazaar prints (acknowledge as modern interpretation)
- Contemporary temple art
- Festival imagery

Always note: "Contemporary devotional representation" to distinguish from historical sources.

### Avoid

- Stock illustration with no cultural grounding
- AI-generated imagery of deities (disrespectful to practitioners)
- Western fantasy art styles
- Mixing incompatible regional traditions without acknowledgment

## Figure Profile Format (Divine)

Replace the standard figure profile with this structure:

```markdown
**[Divine Name]** — [Primary Epithet]

**Domain:** [What they rule, represent, or embody]

**Iconography:**
- Form: [Human, animal, hybrid, abstract]
- Attributes: [Weapons, objects held]
- Vahana: [Vehicle/mount if applicable]
- Mudras/Poses: [Characteristic gestures or stances]
- Color associations: [Blue, gold, red, etc.]

**Key Relationships:**
- [Relationship]: [Figure] — [Brief note]
- [Relationship]: [Figure] — [Brief note]

**Central Myths:**
- [Myth 1 title] — [One line summary]
- [Myth 2 title] — [One line summary]
- [Myth 3 title] — [One line summary]

**Symbolism:** [What this figure represents thematically—2-3 sentences]

**Visual Reference:** [Specific sculpture, painting, or artifact to source]
- Location: [Museum, temple, collection]
- Period: [Date range]
- Why this representation: [What makes it canonical or compelling]
```

### Example: Divine Figure Profile

```markdown
**Hanuman** — The Devoted Servant

**Domain:** Devotion, strength, celibacy, service, the power of the divine name

**Iconography:**
- Form: Monkey-faced humanoid, muscular
- Attributes: Mace (gada), sometimes mountain (Dronagiri)
- Vahana: None (he himself flies)
- Mudras/Poses: Kneeling in devotion, flying, tearing open chest to reveal Rama and Sita
- Color associations: Orange/saffron (devotion), red (strength)

**Key Relationships:**
- Master: Rama — Unwavering devotion, perfect servant
- Mother: Anjana — Born of wind god Vayu's blessing
- Ally: Sugriva — Serves as minister and warrior
- Enemy: Ravana — Burns Lanka with his tail

**Central Myths:**
- The Leap to Lanka — Crosses the ocean in a single bound
- The Burning of Lanka — Tail set aflame, destroys the city
- The Mountain of Herbs — Carries entire mountain to save Lakshmana
- The Chest Revelation — Tears open chest to show Rama lives in his heart

**Symbolism:** The perfection of devotion (bhakti). Hanuman proves that
surrender to the divine grants unlimited power. His celibacy channels
energy into service. He is the ideal devotee—asking nothing, giving
everything.

**Visual Reference:** Chola bronze, 11th century
- Location: Metropolitan Museum of Art
- Period: Chola dynasty, Tamil Nadu
- Why: Captures both strength and devotion; canonical proportions
```

## Mythological Arc Types

Standard narrative arcs don't always fit. Use these mythological structures:

### The Quest (Ramayana pattern)
```
Exile → Trial → Descent → War → Return → Restoration
```
The hero must leave home, face trials, descend into enemy territory, fight the great battle, and return transformed. Order is restored but at cost.

### The War of Dharma (Mahabharata pattern)
```
Inheritance → Exile → Preparation → War → Pyrrhic Victory → Aftermath
```
No pure heroes or villains. Duty conflicts with love. Victory brings grief. The war is won but the world is diminished.

### The Cosmic Cycle (Avatar pattern)
```
Cosmic Imbalance → Divine Recognition → Descent/Birth → Action → Restoration → Withdrawal
```
The divine descends when dharma declines, acts to restore balance, then withdraws. Repeats across ages.

### The Churning (Samudra Manthan pattern)
```
Need → Unlikely Alliance → Sustained Effort → Crisis (Poison) → Treasures → New Conflict
```
Opposites must cooperate. The process produces both poison and nectar. Resolution plants seeds of future conflict.

### The Divine Play (Lila pattern)
```
Apparent Chaos → Hidden Order → Recognition → Joy
```
What seems random or even cruel is revealed as divine play with purpose beyond human comprehension. The devotee learns to see play in all things.

### The Transformation (Shakti pattern)
```
Peaceful Form → Threat → Fierce Form → Destruction → Return to Peace
```
The gentle becomes terrible when necessary. Destruction serves creation. The mother who nurtures also destroys what threatens her children.

## Scroll-Lock Patterns for Mythology

In addition to standard patterns (Reveal, Pan, Zoom, etc.), mythological essays benefit from:

### The Manifestation

**Purpose:** Show the formless becoming form; the divine appearing

**Mechanics:** Particles, light, or smoke coalesce into defined shape. Scroll drives coalescence.

**Best for:**
- Divine appearances (avatars descending)
- Creation sequences
- Visions granted to devotees

**Choreography:**
```
- 0-30% scroll: Formless energy/light/void
- 30-70% scroll: Gradual coalescence, features emerging
- 70-90% scroll: Form solidifies, details sharpen
- 90-100% scroll: Complete manifestation, often with iconographic attributes appearing last
```

### The Cosmic Scale Shift

**Purpose:** Move from human to universal scale; show the infinite within the finite

**Mechanics:** Zoom that transcends physical logic—a figure's mouth contains universes, a body encompasses all creation.

**Best for:**
- Vishvarupa (Krishna's cosmic form)
- Creation myths (Brahma's lotus)
- Moments of divine revelation

**Choreography:**
```
- 0-20% scroll: Human scale, relatable figure
- 20-50% scroll: Begin zoom, hints of vastness
- 50-80% scroll: Scale becomes impossible—galaxies within eyes, worlds within body
- 80-100% scroll: Either return to human scale (awe) or hold at cosmic (transcendence)
```

### The Transformation Sequence

**Purpose:** Show one form becoming another; the many faces of the divine

**Mechanics:** Morph or dissolve transition between distinct forms, maintaining some continuous element.

**Best for:**
- Avatar sequences (ten forms of Vishnu)
- Goddess transformations (Parvati to Durga to Kali)
- Shape-shifting narratives

**Choreography:**
```
- Each form holds for 15-20% of scroll
- Transitions emphasize what changes and what remains
- Consider showing all forms simultaneously at conclusion
```

### The Cycle Return

**Purpose:** Show completion of a cycle; end containing beginning

**Mechanics:** Visual returns to opening state, but transformed—same composition, different understanding.

**Best for:**
- Cosmic cycles (yugas, kalpas)
- Reincarnation narratives
- Stories that frame existence as eternal return

**Choreography:**
```
- Final sequence mirrors opening
- Same visual elements, different color/mood/detail
- User realizes they've returned having been transformed
```

### The Darshan Moment

**Purpose:** Create the experience of seeing and being seen by the divine

**Mechanics:** Slow zoom into deity's eyes, with eyes "activating"—becoming alive, present, seeing the viewer.

**Best for:**
- Devotional climax moments
- Temple/murti sequences
- Moments of divine grace

**Choreography:**
```
- 0-50% scroll: Approach the divine image
- 50-80% scroll: Focus narrows to face, then eyes
- 80-100% scroll: Eyes "awaken"—subtle animation, light, presence
- Hold: Let user feel seen
```

## Progress Bar Concepts for Mythology

| Narrative Type | Progress Concept |
|----------------|------------------|
| Avatar stories | Forms descending sequentially |
| Quest narratives | Journey map / path with stations |
| Cosmic cycles | Wheel rotating through ages |
| Creation myths | Lotus blooming from center |
| Transformation stories | Mandala completing |
| Devotional narratives | Lamp flame growing brighter |
| Battle narratives | Weapons/divine attributes accumulating |

### Detailed Example: Avatar Descent

```
Progress bar as vertical column of ten spaces.
Each chapter completion "descends" an avatar into position.
Current position marked by glowing avatar.
Completed avatars solid, future avatars outlined/dim.
```

## Source Attribution for Mythology

### Textual Sources

Always note:
- **Primary text**: The canonical source (e.g., Valmiki Ramayana, Bhagavata Purana)
- **Book/Kanda/Chapter**: Specific location if citing directly
- **Tradition**: Which sampradaya or regional tradition this version represents
- **Note variations**: "In the Tamil tradition..." or "Bengali retellings emphasize..."

```markdown
**Source:** Valmiki Ramayana, Yuddha Kanda, Chapter 119
**Tradition:** Pan-Hindu, with this version following the Sanskrit north Indian recension
**Note:** South Indian traditions include additional episodes not present here
```

### Visual Sources

```markdown
**Visual:** Rama Breaking the Bow
- Medium: Pahari miniature painting
- Period: c. 1780
- School: Kangra
- Collection: National Museum, New Delhi
- Accession: 56.96/4
```

### When No Attribution Exists

For concepts without clear textual source:
```markdown
**Source:** Oral tradition / folk narrative
**Region:** [Specify]
**Note:** Multiple versions exist; this follows [specific source or collection]
```

## Cultural Sensitivity Guidelines

### Framing Language

**Use:**
- "The tradition tells..."
- "In this narrative..."
- "The text describes..."
- "Devotees understand this as..."
- "The symbolism suggests..."

**Avoid:**
- "Hindus believe..." (homogenizes diverse traditions)
- "The myth of..." (can sound dismissive; use "narrative" or "story")
- "Ancient Indians thought..." (presents as primitive past)
- Definitive statements about "the meaning" (interpretations vary)

### Acknowledge Living Tradition

- These are not historical curiosities but active religious practice
- Millions perform puja to these figures daily
- Interpretations continue to evolve
- Academic and devotional perspectives may differ

### Regional Variation

- Note when following one tradition among many
- Don't privilege Sanskrit/North Indian versions by default
- Tamil, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada traditions have distinct tellings
- Southeast Asian versions (Thai, Balinese, Khmer) are legitimate, not "derivatives"

### Avoid Orientalism

**Red flags:**
- "Mystical East" framing
- Treating complexity as "exotic"
- Noble savage undertones
- Comparing unfavorably to "rational" Western traditions
- Flattening diversity into "Hinduism" as monolith

**Instead:**
- Treat with same rigor as Greek, Norse, or any mythology
- Acknowledge philosophical sophistication
- Note historical context without condescension
- Let the narratives speak for themselves

### Imagery Respect

- No casual use of deities for "aesthetic"
- Murti (sacred images) are not "idols" (loaded colonial term)
- Avoid placing deity images in contexts that would offend practitioners
- When depicting wrathful forms, provide context

## Chapter Schema Adaptations

### Opening Chapter Pattern

Mythological essays often benefit from a **cosmological frame** before diving into narrative:

```markdown
### Prologue: The World Before
*[Cosmic context — the yuga, the state of dharma, the divine backdrop]*

**Metaphor:** [Cosmic metaphor—"When the universe forgot its shape"]

**Content Focus:**
Establish the cosmic stakes. What is the state of dharma? Why does
divine intervention become necessary? What is the age—and what does
that mean for the story to come?

This is not history—this is eternal pattern manifesting in story.
```

### Figure Introduction Pattern

When introducing divine figures, use a **darshan chapter**:

```markdown
### Chapter N: [Figure Name] — [Epithet]
*[Domain or role]*

**Metaphor:** [What this figure embodies]

[Full divine figure profile as specified above]

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: "The Darshan"**
Approach the divine through their iconography. Build from attributes
to form to face to eyes.
```

### Climax Pattern

Mythological climaxes often involve **cosmic revelation** rather than just battle:

```markdown
### Chapter N: The Vision
*[Moment of transcendence]*

**Metaphor:** [The infinite in the finite]

**Content Focus:**
The devotee/hero sees beyond mortal perception. The divine reveals
its true form. Everything changes—not in the world, but in
understanding.

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: "The Vishvarupa" / "The Cosmic Form"**
[Use Cosmic Scale Shift pattern]
```

## Example: Mythological Invocation Structure

```
Hero: Cosmic/symbolic opening (manifestation, creation moment)

Chapter 1: Cosmological frame (the age, the imbalance, the need)
Chapter 2: Divine decision (the avatar descends, the goddess awakens)
Chapter 3-N: Narrative chapters following mythological arc type
Chapter N-1: The climax (battle, revelation, transformation)
Chapter N: Resolution and meaning (dharma restored, cycle continues)

Epilogue: Return to cosmic frame (the pattern continues, the story is eternal)
```
