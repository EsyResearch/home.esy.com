## Quote Usage Guidelines

### For Writers

When using these quotes in the visual essay:

1. **Verified (✅)**: Use freely with attribution
2. **Attributed (⚠️)**: Use with attribution; note "attributed to" if being precise
3. **Paraphrased (📝)**: Do not present as direct quote; describe as "accounts suggest" or "chroniclers noted"

### Quote Integration Examples

**Good** (for attributed quote):
> Peter Damian, the fierce reforming cardinal, delivered his verdict: the princess's fork use was "excessive delicacy."

**Better** (acknowledging attribution):
