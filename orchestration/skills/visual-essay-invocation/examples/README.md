# Invocation Examples

Condensed reference examples demonstrating format and depth expectations for visual essay invocations.

---

## Purpose

Examples are **incomplete templates**—they show the expected structure, tone, and depth for each section of an invocation document. Use these as format guides when studying the invocation pattern.

These are NOT production-ready specifications. For finished, actionable invocations, see [`specs/`](../specs/).

---

## Current Examples

| Example | Topic Type | Demonstrates |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| `history-of-ai.md` | Technology/History | Photorealistic treatment, era-based color grading, timeline navigation |

---

## How to Use

1. **Review** an example to understand expected depth
2. **Reference** format patterns (hero structure, chapter schema, scroll-lock specs)
3. **Invoke** the Visual Essay Invocation Agent to generate production specs
4. **Find** generated specs in `specs/`

## Examples vs Specs

| Aspect | Examples | Specs |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Format reference | Production specification |
| **Completeness** | Condensed, partial | Complete, actionable |
| **Status** | Static reference | Has status (DRAFT/REVIEWED/IMPLEMENTED) |
| **Location** | `examples/` | `specs/` |
| **Generated by** | Human-curated | Visual Essay Invocation Agent |
