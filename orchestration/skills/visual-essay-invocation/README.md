# Invocation Examples

This directory contains generated invocations for reference and learning.

## Purpose

Examples serve two functions:
1. **Quality benchmark** — Agents reference these to understand depth and format expectations
2. **Accumulated knowledge** — Successful patterns get captured for reuse

## Status Levels

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[DRAFT]` | Recently generated, not yet reviewed |
| `[REVIEWED]` | Human-validated, confirmed quality |
| `[CANONICAL]` | Promoted to references/ as gold standard |

## Adding Examples

After generating an invocation:
1. Save to this directory as `[topic-slug].md`
2. Add `[DRAFT]` prefix to filename or header
3. Flag for human review
4. Update status after validation

## Naming Convention

Use kebab-case matching the topic:
- `history-of-ai.md`
- `manhattan-project.md`
- `blockchain.md`
- `fall-of-soviet-union.md`

## Promotion Criteria

An example should be promoted to `references/` when it:
- Has been used successfully in production
- Demonstrates patterns worth codifying
- Represents a novel subject type or visual treatment
- Received positive user feedback

## Current Examples

| File | Subject | Status | Visual Treatment |
|------|---------|--------|------------------|
| `history-of-ai.md` | AI from Turing to present | [REVIEWED] | Photorealistic, era-based |
