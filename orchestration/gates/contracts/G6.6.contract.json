The Prose Quality Auditor MUST be a different agent/session than the content producer (G5). The audit evaluates writing craft on five dimensions with weighted scoring. The regex_match validations catch obvious slop patterns in the contract enforcement layer, but the full audit report provides the detailed evaluation. Created per Gate Accountability Standard §Production+QA Interleaving."
