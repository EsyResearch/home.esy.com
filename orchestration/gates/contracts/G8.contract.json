The Publish Artifact Orchestrator invokes: Bibliography Orchestrator (audit mode), Audit Orchestrator (quality domains), Design Slop Auditor (distinctiveness check), Social Media Meta Expert, SEO Audit Agent, and Gate Guard Auditor (G1-G7 verification). If issues are found, QA Remediation Orchestrator runs first. Certification status must be GO or CONDITIONAL to proceed to G9. NO-GO blocks the pipeline. The design slop audit is mandatory at G8 per the Gate Accountability Standard."
