  "notes": "G5.2 is a structural integration gate. The Design Research Integration Agent checks that CSS custom properties defined in DESIGN-RESEARCH.md are used in the CSS file, and that className values in TSX have corresponding CSS selectors. Automated coverage checking (≥95%) is beyond the current validator's capability, so this gate relies on the agent's report. The runner validates file existence as a prerequisite."
