# Prompt Variables Analysis Report

## Summary
I've analyzed the prompt library system and found significant issues with variable definitions.

## Key Findings

### 1. Variable System Overview
- The system uses a `variables` property in each prompt object to define customizable placeholders
- Variables are displayed in the UI with input fields for customization
- The `updateVariable` function stores user input for each variable
- The `getCustomizedPrompt` function replaces placeholders with user-provided values

### 2. Missing Variable Definitions
Out of 68 total prompts, **53 prompts (78%) are missing their variable definitions** despite having placeholders in their prompt text.

### 3. Working vs Non-Working Prompts
**Working prompts (IDs 1-15):**
- All have properly defined `variables` arrays
- Examples:
  - ID 1: `variables: ['GENRE']`
  - ID 2: `variables: ['SETTING', 'CONFLICT_TYPE']`
  - ID 3: `variables: ['GENRE', 'TIME_PERIOD']`

**Non-working prompts (IDs 16-68):**
- Missing the `variables` property entirely
- Have placeholders in prompt text but no way for users to customize them
- Example: ID 16 has `[DATA_TYPE]` and `[ANALYTICAL_APPROACH]` in the prompt but no `variables` array

### 4. Impact on User Experience
1. Users see prompts with placeholders like `[DATA_TYPE]` but no input fields to customize them
2. The UI shows "This prompt has no customizable variables" for these prompts
3. Users cannot properly use 78% of the prompts without manually editing the placeholders

- BOOK_TYPE, PUBLISHING_GOAL
- EXPERTISE_AREA, LEARNING_FORMAT
- LIFE_THEME, TARGET_MESSAGE
- RESEARCH_FIELD, PUBLICATION_TYPE
- BUSINESS_FOCUS, AUTHORITY_GOAL
- CONTENT_TYPE, FORMAT_PRIORITY

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fix**: Add the missing `variables` property to all prompts (IDs 16-68) with their respective variable arrays
2. **Code Quality**: Consider creating a validation function to ensure all prompts with placeholders have corresponding variables defined
3. **Testing**: Add unit tests to verify the integrity of prompt definitions
4. **Documentation**: Document the required format for prompt objects to prevent future issues

## Code Issues Found

The `getCustomizedPrompt` function works correctly but only replaces variables that are defined in the `variables` array. Since most prompts are missing this array, the placeholders remain unreplaced in the output.
