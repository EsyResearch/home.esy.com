# Template vs Implementation Analysis

## Critical Finding

The template file `new-prompt-library-ai-reference.txt` contains the CORRECT implementation with all `variables` properties properly defined for every prompt. However, the actual implementation in `page.tsx` is missing the `variables` property for 53 out of 68 prompts (IDs 16-68).

## Comparison Results

### Template (CORRECT) ✅
All prompts in the template have properly defined variables:

- **ID 16**: `variables: ['DATA_TYPE', 'ANALYTICAL_APPROACH']`
- **ID 17**: `variables: ['RESEARCH_HYPOTHESIS', 'DATA_TYPE']`
- **ID 25**: `variables: ['RESEARCH_AREA', 'IMPACT_TYPE']`
- **ID 30**: `variables: ['WORK_ONE', 'WORK_TWO']`
- **ID 40**: `variables: ['SUBJECT_A', 'SUBJECT_B']`
- **ID 50**: `variables: ['RESEARCH_QUESTION', 'METHODOLOGY']`
- **ID 60**: `variables: ['SUBJECT', 'TARGET_READER']`

### Implementation (BROKEN) ❌
The implementation in `page.tsx` is missing the `variables` property for all prompts from ID 16 onwards.

## Root Cause

It appears that when the prompts were copied from the template to the implementation, the `variables` property was accidentally omitted for prompts 16-68. This is likely a copy-paste error where only partial prompt objects were transferred.

## Impact

1. **User Experience**: 78% of prompts are unusable without manual placeholder editing
2. **Functionality**: The variable customization system is completely broken for most prompts
3. **UI Inconsistency**: Users see "This prompt has no customizable variables" for prompts that clearly have placeholders

## Solution

The fix is straightforward: Copy the `variables` property from the template for each affected prompt (IDs 16-68) into the implementation.

## Example Fix

For prompt ID 16, change from:
```javascript
{
  id: 16,
  category: 'research',
  title: 'Qualitative Data Analysis Engine',
  description: 'Systematic approach to interview and observation data',
  prompt: `Analyze [DATA_TYPE] using [ANALYTICAL_APPROACH] methodology:...`
  isPro: false
}
```

To:
```javascript
{
  id: 16,
  category: 'research',
  title: 'Qualitative Data Analysis Engine',
  description: 'Systematic approach to interview and observation data',
  shortDescription: 'Transform qualitative data into meaningful insights',
  variables: ['DATA_TYPE', 'ANALYTICAL_APPROACH'],
  prompt: `Analyze [DATA_TYPE] using [ANALYTICAL_APPROACH] methodology:...`
  isPro: false
}
```

## Missing Fields

Additionally, the implementation is missing the `shortDescription` field for prompts 16-68, which is present in the template.

## Verification

The template serves as the source of truth and contains all necessary data. A simple copy operation of the missing `variables` and `shortDescription` fields from the template to the implementation will resolve all issues.
