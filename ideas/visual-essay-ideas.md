## Selection Criteria

When choosing the next essay to run through the pipeline, prioritize:

1. **Visualization diversity** — pick essays that test different diagram types than previous runs
2. **Pipeline gap exposure** — pick essays likely to reveal weaknesses in current agents/contracts
3. **Domain range** — alternate between scientific, historical, data journalism, and conceptual essays
4. **Complexity ladder** — start with medium complexity, then push to high
