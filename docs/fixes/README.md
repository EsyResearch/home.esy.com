## How to Use

### Creating a New Fix Document

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to a new file with format: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`
   ```bash
   cp TEMPLATE.md 2025-01-20-fix-navigation-scroll.md
   ```

2. Fill out all sections of the template
3. Be specific and include code examples
4. Link to relevant PRs, issues, and commits

### Best Practices

1. **File Naming**
   - Use ISO date format: YYYY-MM-DD
   - Use lowercase with hyphens
   - Be descriptive but concise
   - Examples:
     - ✅ `2025-01-20-fix-memory-leak-image-upload.md`
     - ✅ `2025-01-20-optimize-database-queries.md`
     - ❌ `fix1.md`
     - ❌ `navigation_bug_FINAL.md`

2. **Content Guidelines**
   - Write for future you (or a new team member)
   - Include actual error messages
   - Show before/after code snippets
   - Document "why" not just "what"
   - Include performance metrics if relevant

3. **Categories**
   - **Bug**: Something that was broken
   - **Performance**: Speed or efficiency improvements
   - **Security**: Vulnerability fixes
   - **Feature**: New functionality issues
   - **UI-UX**: User interface or experience problems

4. **Severity Levels**
   - **Critical**: System down, data loss, security breach
   - **High**: Major feature broken, significant user impact
   - **Medium**: Feature partially broken, workaround available
   - **Low**: Minor issue, cosmetic problems
