## Previous Iterations

### Legacy Version

- **Used**: Until January 2025
- **Issue**: Mixed terminology (paper vs essays), "assistant" less powerful than "Agent"

## Alternative Options Considered

### Option 1: Capability-Focused (Original Version with "Paper")
**"Write your next paper with Esy, an AI Agent that researches, cites, and helps you craft original academic content in your unique writing style."**

### Option 2: Problem-Solution
**"Esy is an AI Agent that eliminates writer's block, formats citations automatically, and helps you write better papers faster."**

- **Pros**: Addresses real pain points, specific benefits
- **Cons**: Product-focused rather than user-focused

## Rejected Options (With Fake Metrics)

### Social Proof Version (Rejected - No fake numbers policy)
~~"Join 100,000+ researchers who use Esy's AI Agent to write papers 10x faster while maintaining academic integrity and originality."~~

- **Rejected**: Contains fake user numbers and unverified claims

### Authority Version (Rejected - Unverifiable claims)
~~"Write your next paper with Esy, an AI Agent trained on millions of academic papers that helps you research, cite, and write with scholarly precision."~~

- **Rejected**: "Millions of papers" claim unverifiable

## Key Learnings

1. **User-First Language**: Starting with "Write your next..." performs better than "Esy is..."
2. **Brand Alignment**: "Essay" aligns better with brand name than "paper"
3. **Honesty Builds Trust**: No fake numbers or unverifiable claims
4. **Address Core Fears**: Must address originality and personal style concerns
5. **Action-Oriented**: CTAs that assume user action ("Write your next") convert better

## Conversion Psychology Notes

- **Rule of Three**: People remember things in threes (research, cite, craft)
- **Personal Connection**: "your unique writing style" creates emotional resonance
- **Pain Point Address**: Each benefit targets fundamental academic concerns
- **Trust Building**: "Original academic content" directly tackles plagiarism fears

## A/B Testing Recommendations

When user base grows, test these variations:
1. Essay vs Paper terminology
2. AI Agent vs AI Writing Partner
3. Feature-focused vs Benefit-focused
4. Short vs Long descriptions
5. With/without specific academic credentials
