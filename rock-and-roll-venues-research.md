- **Original purpose:** Farewell tour for Jane's Addiction

### Inspiration

- "Changed the trajectory of the '90s, helping usher the alternative era into the mainstream"
- "Provided a common home for artists on the mainstream periphery"
- Dave Grohl (Nirvana): The festival helped change mentalities in the music industry

### Evolution
- 1991-1997: Annual touring festival
- 1998-2003: Hiatus/sporadic events
- **2005:** Revived as destination festival in Chicago
- **Current:** One of the world's major annual music festivals

### Current Status
- **Location:** Grant Park, Chicago (since 2005)
- **International editions:** Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, and others
- **Documentary:** "Lolla: The Story of Lollapalooza" (2024)

### Visual Description
