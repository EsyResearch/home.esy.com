- ❌ **NEVER reuse design systems from previous scrollytelling pieces**
- ❌ **NEVER copy color palettes, typography, or visual patterns from other stories**
- ❌ **NEVER skip Design Research phase—every story demands its own visual identity**

## Design Research Framework (MANDATORY)

### Core Principle: Every Story Deserves Its Own Visual Identity

**CRITICAL**: Each scrollytelling piece MUST have a unique design system derived from research into the subject matter itself. Copying or adapting designs from previous stories is strictly prohibited.

### Why Design Research Matters

The visual language of a scrollytelling piece should emerge organically from its subject. A story about spoons should not look like a story about basketball. A story about Renaissance art should not look like a story about space exploration. The design IS part of the story.

### Design Research Process

**Step 1: Subject Matter Visual Archaeology**
Research the visual history of the subject itself:
- What materials are associated with this subject? (wood, metal, fabric, stone, etc.)
- What colors dominate historical representations?
- What textures, patterns, and motifs recur?
- What eras does this subject span, and how do aesthetics change?
- What cultural contexts shaped this subject's visual identity?

**Step 2: Brand & Cultural Association Analysis**
Identify the subject's "brand" in collective consciousness:
- What emotions does this subject evoke?
- What aesthetic movements relate to this subject?
- What existing visual treatments exist (museums, books, documentaries)?
- What would feel authentic vs. incongruent?

**Step 3: Material-Driven Palette Development**
Derive colors from the subject's physical reality:
- For metallic subjects: actual metal tones (silver, gold, copper, bronze, steel)
- For organic subjects: natural material colors (wood grains, plant greens, stone grays)
- For cultural subjects: colors from the relevant culture's palette
- For abstract subjects: colors that evoke the concept metaphorically

**Step 4: Typography Research**
Select fonts that align with the subject's era and character:
- Historical subjects: period-appropriate typefaces
- Luxury/refinement subjects: elegant serifs, refined sans-serifs
- Industrial subjects: sturdy, utilitarian typefaces
- Cultural subjects: fonts that honor the culture without stereotyping
- Consider the subject's "voice"—is it formal? Playful? Ancient? Modern?

**Step 5: Animation & Interaction Philosophy**
Match motion design to the subject's nature:
- Liquid subjects: flowing, organic animations
- Mechanical subjects: precise, engineered movements
- Natural subjects: growth-based, organic reveals
- Cultural subjects: animations inspired by the culture's art/movement traditions
- Historical subjects: pacing that evokes the era (slower for ancient, faster for modern)

### Design Research Deliverables

Before any implementation, the Design Research phase must produce:

```markdown
## Design Research Report: [Subject]

### Visual Archaeology Findings
- Primary materials: [list]
- Historical color associations: [list with hex codes]
- Recurring visual motifs: [list]
- Era-specific aesthetics: [describe]

### Proposed Color Palette
- Primary: [hex] — derived from [subject connection]
- Secondary: [hex] — derived from [subject connection]
- Accent: [hex] — derived from [subject connection]
- Background: [hex] — derived from [subject connection]
- Text: [hex] — contrast-checked

### Typography Stack
- Display: [font name] — because [subject connection]
- Serif: [font name] — because [subject connection]
- Body: [font name] — because [subject connection]

### Animation Philosophy
- Overall tempo: [fast/medium/slow] — because [subject connection]
- Reveal style: [fade/slide/grow/etc.] — because [subject connection]
- Parallax intensity: [subtle/moderate/dramatic] — because [subject connection]
- Special effects: [describe] — because [subject connection]

### Visual Motifs
- Decorative elements inspired by: [subject-specific elements]
- Section transitions evoke: [subject-specific metaphor]
- Progress indicator concept: [subject-specific design]

### Differentiation Check
- How does this differ from other Esy scrollytelling pieces?
- What makes this design unmistakably "about [subject]"?
```

### Design Research Examples

**Example: History of the Spoon**
- Materials: bone, wood, ceramic, silver, stainless steel
- Colors: ivory whites, warm wood browns, tarnished silver, porcelain blues, stainless grays
- Typography: elegant dining serifs (Didot, Garamond) + refined sans (Gill Sans)
- Motifs: oval bowl shapes, reflective surfaces, table setting geometry
- Animation: gentle, dining-table-appropriate pace; smooth transitions like stirring

**Example: History of Basketball**
- Materials: leather, hardwood, rubber, metal hoops
- Colors: burnt orange (basketball), hardwood browns, gymnasium gold, court-line white
- Typography: athletic display fonts (Bebas Neue) + sporty serifs
- Motifs: circular basketball shapes, court lines, net patterns
- Animation: bouncing, energetic, athletic movements; fast-paced

**Example: History of the Printing Press**
- Materials: wood, metal type, paper, ink
- Colors: aged paper cream, iron black, lead gray, letterpress red
- Typography: Blackletter for historical, Caslon for classical, industrial sans
- Motifs: type blocks, paper textures, mechanical gears, woodcut aesthetics
- Animation: stamping/pressing motions; reveals like pages turning

**Example: History of High Heels**
- Materials: leather, silk, wood, precious metals, modern synthetics
- Colors: luxurious burgundies, patent leather blacks, Louboutin red, gold accents
- Typography: high-fashion serifs (Didot, Bodoni) + elegant sans
- Motifs: shoe silhouettes, heel angles, runway geometry
- Animation: strutting rhythm, elevation/height reveals, glamorous transitions

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Generic Dark Mode**: Not every story is dark/moody
❌ **Default Gradients**: Gradients must be derived from subject
❌ **Safe Sans-Serif**: Inter/Roboto are lazy defaults—research the right font
❌ **Burnt Orange Overuse**: One story's accent is not universal
❌ **Copy-Paste Layouts**: Each story may need unique section structures
❌ **Generic Progress Bar**: Progress indicators can be subject-specific

### Validation Questions

Before finalizing design:
1. If I removed all text, would someone guess the subject from visuals alone?
2. Does this design pay homage to the subject's material/cultural history?
3. Could this design work for ANY topic, or is it specific to THIS topic?
4. Have I actually researched the subject's visual history, or assumed?
5. Does the animation style reflect the subject's character (slow/fast, organic/mechanical)?

      const currentProgress = (window.scrollY / scrollHeight) * 100;
      setProgress(currentProgress);
    };
    
    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll, { passive: true });
    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div className="progress-bar">
      <div className="progress-fill" style={{ width: `${progress}%` }} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Section with Intersection Observer**
```tsx
const Section: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const sectionRef = useRef<HTMLElement>(null);
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      ([entry]) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) setIsVisible(true);
      },
      { threshold: 0.2 }
    );

    if (sectionRef.current) observer.observe(sectionRef.current);
    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, []);

  return (
    <section ref={sectionRef} className={`section ${isVisible ? 'visible' : ''}`}>
      {children}
    </section>
  );
};
```

**Parallax Container**
```tsx
const ParallaxElement: React.FC<{ speed: number; children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ speed, children }) => {
  const [offset, setOffset] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleScroll = () => setOffset(window.scrollY * speed);
    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll, { passive: true });
    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  }, [speed]);

  return (
    <div style={{ transform: `translateY(${offset}px)` }}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### CSS Animation Patterns

**Fade-In on Scroll**
```css
.section {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(40px);
  transition: all 0.8s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}

.section.visible {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}
```

**Staggered Children**
```css
.section.visible .animate-child:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0.1s; }
.section.visible .animate-child:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.2s; }
.section.visible .animate-child:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }
```

**Shimmer Text**
```css
.shimmer-text {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #color1 0%, #color2 50%, #color1 100%);
  background-size: 200% auto;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
  animation: shimmer 8s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes shimmer {
  0% { background-position: 200% center; }
  100% { background-position: -200% center; }
}
```
