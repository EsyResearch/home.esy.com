## Standards for AI-Generated Historical Content

### Special Considerations
AI-generated historical content requires heightened scrutiny for:
- **Fabricated Sources**: Verify all cited sources actually exist

- **Missing Nuance**: Reduction of complex debates to simple statements

### Verification Protocol for AI Content
1. Flag all specific factual claims for verification
2. Demand sources for any claim not commonly known
3. Cross-check dates, names, and places against multiple authoritative sources
4. Assess if narrative suspiciously lacks scholarly complexity
5. Identify where consensus claims may mask ongoing debates
6. Check for anachronistic language or concepts
7. Verify that cause-and-effect relationships are supported by scholarship
