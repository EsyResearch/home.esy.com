## Naming Convention

```

## Report Structure

All audit reports follow a standardized structure:

1. **Visual Essay Information** - Title, path, date, auditor, duration
2. **Executive Summary** - Certification status, overall score, category breakdown
3. **Key Findings** - Quick wins and blockers
4. **Detailed Findings** - Per-category analysis with evidence
5. **Required Fixes (Blocking)** - Must resolve before publication
6. **Recommended Improvements (Non-Blocking)** - Nice to have
7. **Testing Evidence** - Screenshots, device logs, performance recordings
8. **Certification Decision** - Final status with conditions

## Certification Statuses

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| ✅ **CERTIFIED** | Passes all requirements | Ready for publication |
| ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** | Passes with conditions | Fix blocking issues, then re-audit |
| ❌ **REJECTED** | Fails critical requirements | Major rework required |

## Integration with Quality Gates

Audit reports serve as evidence for quality gates in the Visual Essay Director pipeline:

- **G5: Citation Audit** → `citation-audit-*.md`
- **G6: Scroll Certification** → `scroll-audit-*.md`
- **Visual Auditor** → `visual-audit-*.md`

## Usage

### Saving an Audit Report

After an auditor agent completes an audit, save the report here:

```bash
# Example
agents/audit-reports/scroll-audit-the-thinking-machine-2024-12-09.md
```

### Referencing in Pipeline

When the Visual Essay Director checks gate status, it can reference these reports:

```markdown
## G6: Scroll Certification
**Status**: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL
**Report**: [scroll-audit-the-thinking-machine-2024-12-09.md](./scroll-audit-the-thinking-machine-2024-12-09.md)
**Conditions**: 
1. Complete real device testing on Safari iOS
2. Verify 60fps on iPhone 12+
```

## Archive Policy

- Keep all reports for published essays indefinitely
- Archive reports for unpublished/abandoned essays after 90 days
- Re-audits should create new reports (don't overwrite)
