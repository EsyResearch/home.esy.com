## Agent Details

### Scrollytelling Invocation Enhancer
**File:** `scrollytelling-invocation-enhancer.md`

**Role:** Expert prompt architect that transforms rough requests into comprehensive, structured briefs for scrollytelling agents. Asks strategic clarifying questions when needed.

**🚀 USE THIS FIRST:** Before invoking any scrollytelling agent, run your request through this enhancer for maximum quality output.

**Best For:**
- Transforming rough ideas into structured briefs
- Getting strategic questions to maximize output quality
- Auto-detecting target agent (children's vs general)
- Generating character names, themes, and visual directions
- Ensuring world-class scrollytelling output

**Operating Modes:**
| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Quick** | `enhance this request:` | Uses intelligent defaults, no questions |
| **Guided** | `enhance with questions:` | Always asks 2-6 strategic questions first |
| **Auto** | Just provide request | Asks questions only if ambiguous |

**What It Does:**
1. **Detects** which agent your request is for (children's or general)
2. **Assesses** clarity — is the request clear or ambiguous?
3. **Asks** 2-6 high-impact questions (if needed)
4. **Fills gaps** with intelligent defaults
5. **Outputs** a complete structured brief ready for the target agent

**Invocation Examples:**
```
# Quick mode — trust the defaults
Using @agents/scrollytelling-invocation-enhancer.md, enhance this request:
"story about a bunny who learns to share"

# Guided mode — I want to answer questions first
Using @agents/scrollytelling-invocation-enhancer.md, enhance with questions:
"a story about an owl"

# Auto mode — ask if needed
Using @agents/scrollytelling-invocation-enhancer.md:
"scrollytelling about how coffee was discovered"
```

**Strategic Questions It Asks:**
- 🎯 "What lesson should the child take away?"
- 🌙 "Bedtime-cozy or playtime-energetic?"
- 🔤 "Weave in counting, a letter, or pure story?"
- ⏱️ "Quick story or journey story?"
- 🎨 "Any visual inspiration?"

**Why Use This:**
| Without Enhancer | With Enhancer |
|------------------|---------------|
| "make a mouse story" | Full brief with character name, personality, theme, emotions, visual style, participation mechanics, animation priorities |
| Gaps → suboptimal output | Strategic questions → exactly what you envisioned |
| Agent makes assumptions | You control high-impact decisions |

## Orchestrator Architecture

### What is an Orchestrator?

An **orchestrator agent** coordinates multiple specialized agents to produce complex deliverables. Unlike standalone agents that work independently, orchestrators:

1. **Define the workflow** — Sequence of agent invocations
2. **Set quality gates** — Approval checkpoints between stages
3. **Integrate outputs** — Combine deliverables from multiple agents
4. **Enforce standards** — Ensure all agents follow shared requirements

### Current Orchestrators

| Orchestrator | Domain | Agents Coordinated | Output |
|--------------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| `scrollytelling-expert.md` | Digital Storytelling | 6 agents | Mobile-native scrollytelling pages |
| `childrens-fiction-scrollytelling-agent.md` | **Children's Stories (3-6)** | 4 agents | Magical animated children's experiences |
| `scrollytelling-audit-agent.md` | Quality Assurance | 3-4 agents | Experience audit reports |
| `citation-audit-agent.md` | **Citation Integrity** | 2-3 agents | Source verification reports |

### When to Use Orchestrator vs Standalone

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Complete scrollytelling page | Use `scrollytelling-expert.md` (orchestrator) |
| Just need sources | Use `research-citations-expert.md` (standalone) |
| Just need fact-check | Use `historian-editor-expert.md` (standalone) |
| Just need UI component | Use `ui-ux-design-expert.md` (standalone) |
| Performance optimization only | Use `immersive-experience-engineer.md` (standalone) |
| Complex, multi-deliverable project | Consider orchestrator pattern |

### Invoking an Orchestrator

When you invoke an orchestrator, it **automatically coordinates** all required agents:

```
# This single invocation triggers the full 6-agent workflow:
Apply @agents/scrollytelling-expert.md to create a scrollytelling 
experience about "The History of Coffee"

# The orchestrator will:
# 1. Conduct Design Research
# 2. Coordinate source discovery
# 3. Direct narrative writing
# 4. Enforce fact-checking
# 5. Guide visual refinement  
# 6. Ensure mobile-native implementation
# 7. Perform final review
```

---

## Multi-Agent Workflows

### Scrollytelling Production Pipeline

The recommended workflow for creating **mobile-native** scrollytelling content:

```
1.  @agents/scrollytelling-expert.md        → Design Research (mobile-first visual identity)
2.  @agents/research-citations-expert.md    → Source Discovery (Tier 1-2 only)
3.  @agents/scrollytelling-expert.md        → Story Architecture (mobile layouts first)
4.  @agents/historian-writer-expert.md      → Narrative Draft
5.  @agents/historian-editor-expert.md      → Fact-Check
6.  @agents/research-citations-expert.md    → Final Source Audit
7.  @agents/ui-ux-design-expert.md          → Visual Refinement (mobile typography)
8.  @agents/software-engineering-expert.md  → Component Implementation
9.  @agents/immersive-experience-engineer.md → Mobile-Native Layer (60fps, touch, Theatre Bar)
10. @agents/citation-audit-agent.md         → Citation Verification (claim-source mapping) ⚠️ NEW
11. @agents/scrollytelling-expert.md        → Final Review (real device testing)
```

**Key Additions:**
- Step 9 (`immersive-experience-engineer.md`) ensures the final experience feels like a native app, not a website. This includes 60fps animations, touch interactions, hidden browser chrome, and Theatre Bar integration.
- Step 10 (`citation-audit-agent.md`) verifies all citations are valid, sources are Tier 1-2, links work, and claims have proper support. **BLOCKING**: Cannot publish without citation certification.

### Quick Content Creation

For faster iteration, use combined invocations:

```
Using @agents/scrollytelling-expert.md with support from 
@agents/research-citations-expert.md, create a complete 
scrollytelling experience about [topic] with verified sources.
```

## Meta-Framework

For creating new agents or understanding the underlying architecture, see:

**`META-AGENT-FRAMEWORK.md`** — The abstract parent framework that defines:
- Required structural components
- Role definition patterns
- Quality assurance frameworks
- Collaboration protocols
- Agent creation checklist

---

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include topic, scope, and any constraints in your prompt
2. **Reference the File**: Always use `@agents/[name].md` for clear invocation
3. **Chain Agents**: For complex tasks, invoke multiple agents in sequence
4. **Trust the Framework**: Agents have built-in quality checks—let them work
5. **Provide Context**: The more context you give, the better the output

## ⚠️ Known Style Conflicts (Scrollytelling)

### Global CSS Bleeding into Scrollytelling Pages

**Problem:** The global `globals.css` file contains styles for common class names (like `.hero-content`) that can bleed into scrollytelling story pages and cause unexpected layout issues.

**Specific Issue: `.hero-content` Two-Column Split**

In `src/app/globals.css`:
```css
.hero-content {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;  /* Causes two-column layout! */
  gap: 4rem;
}
```

This global rule applies to ANY element with class `.hero-content`, including those inside scrollytelling stories. On wide screens (>1024px), this causes hero content to split into two columns unexpectedly.

**Solution:** Always override global styles in scrollytelling-specific CSS:

```css
/* In your-story.css */
.your-story .hero-content {
  /* Override global grid styles */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  grid-template-columns: unset;
  gap: unset;
}
```

**Prevention Checklist:**
- [ ] Use unique class prefixes (`.firearm-story .hero-content` not just `.hero-content`)
- [ ] Explicitly set `display`, `grid-template-columns`, `flex-direction` in story CSS
- [ ] Test on wide desktop screens (1440px+) to catch layout bleed
- [ ] Consider using CSS Modules or more specific selectors

**Other Potentially Conflicting Global Classes:**
- `.hero-title`, `.hero-subtitle`, `.hero-description`
- `.section`, `.content`
- Any generic layout class names

**Rule of Thumb:** If your scrollytelling uses a class name that sounds generic, check `globals.css` for conflicts and add explicit overrides.

## Mobile-First Scrollytelling (Critical)

**70%+ of scrollytelling users are on mobile.** Every scrollytelling piece must:

| Requirement | Agent Responsible |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Design mobile-first layouts | `scrollytelling-expert.md` |
| 60fps animations on mobile | `immersive-experience-engineer.md` |
| Touch-friendly (44px+ targets) | `immersive-experience-engineer.md` |
| Safe area handling (notches) | `immersive-experience-engineer.md` |
| Theatre Bar integration | `immersive-experience-engineer.md` |
| Real device testing | Both |

**Quick Mobile Check:**
- [ ] Tested on real iPhone (not just browser)
- [ ] Tested on real Android
- [ ] All tap targets reachable with thumb
- [ ] No horizontal scroll
- [ ] Feels like an app, not a website
