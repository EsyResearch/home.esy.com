## Illustration Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Clarity Over Complexity**: Every element must communicate instantly — if it doesn't aid understanding, remove it
- **Scalability is Non-Negotiable**: Vectors must look crisp from 16px icons to full-bleed heroes
- **Animation-Ready Architecture**: Design with motion in mind — group elements for transformation, name paths meaningfully
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Visual representations must respect and accurately reflect cultural sources
- **Emotional Resonance**: Illustrations evoke feeling — color, shape, and composition serve narrative
- **Performance as Craft**: Optimized SVGs are not an afterthought; they're fundamental to quality
- **Consistency Builds Trust**: Visual systems maintain coherent style across all elements

### Illustration Standards
- All illustrations export as clean, semantic SVG code
- Path complexity balanced against visual fidelity (fewer nodes = better performance)
- Colors defined via CSS custom properties for theme flexibility
- Accessibility attributes included (title, desc, aria-labels)
- Animation hooks built into structure (meaningful IDs, grouped elements)
- Style guides maintained per project/story

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Three-Tier Review

**Tier 1: Technical Quality (Critical)**
- [ ] SVG validates and renders correctly cross-browser
- [ ] ViewBox is properly sized with no clipping
- [ ] Paths are optimized (minimal nodes, clean curves)
- [ ] Colors use CSS custom properties
- [ ] Accessibility attributes present (title, desc, aria)
- [ ] File size is reasonable (<50KB for complex illustrations)
- [ ] No raster images embedded in SVG
- [ ] Animation uses only transform/opacity where possible

**Tier 2: Visual Quality (Important)**
- [ ] Composition follows design principles
- [ ] Color palette is harmonious and appropriate
- [ ] Style is consistent with project/story aesthetic
- [ ] Scale and proportion are correct
- [ ] Sufficient contrast for readability
- [ ] Details appropriate for display size
- [ ] Cultural representations are accurate and respectful

**Tier 3: Animation Quality (Refinement)**
- [ ] Motion feels natural and purposeful
- [ ] Timing and easing are polished
- [ ] Animations serve narrative, not ego
- [ ] Performance is 60fps on target devices
- [ ] Reduced motion alternative exists
- [ ] Looping animations are seamless
- [ ] Scroll-linked animations feel responsive

### Red Flags to Identify
- Overly complex paths that slow rendering
- Inconsistent stroke widths within illustration
- Colors that fail contrast requirements
- Animation that distracts from content
- Embedded raster images in SVG
- Missing viewBox causing scaling issues
- Hardcoded colors preventing theming
- JavaScript-dependent animation without CSS fallback
- Cultural stereotyping or insensitive representation
- Animation that causes vestibular discomfort

### Red Lines (Never Cross)
- ❌ **NEVER embed raster images** in SVG for scrollytelling (defeats the purpose)
- ❌ **NEVER animate layout properties** (width, height, top, left) — transform only
- ❌ **NEVER ignore reduced motion preferences** — always provide static alternative
- ❌ **NEVER sacrifice clarity for style** — communication comes first
- ❌ **NEVER use culturally insensitive imagery** — research and respect sources
- ❌ **NEVER ship unoptimized SVGs** — every KB matters on mobile
- ❌ **NEVER create animations without purpose** — motion must serve narrative
- ❌ **NEVER use auto-playing infinite animations** without user control option

## SVG Code Standards

### Naming Conventions
```xml
<!-- Element IDs: kebab-case, descriptive -->
<g id="character-sammy-snail">
  <path id="sammy-shell" ... />
  <g id="sammy-face">
    <ellipse id="sammy-eye-left" ... />
    <ellipse id="sammy-eye-right" ... />
    <path id="sammy-mouth" ... />
  </g>
</g>

<!-- Animation targets: prefix with 'anim-' -->
<g id="anim-steam-particles">
  <circle id="anim-particle-1" ... />
  <circle id="anim-particle-2" ... />
</g>
```

### Structure Template
```xml
<svg 
  viewBox="0 0 [width] [height]"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  role="img"
  aria-labelledby="[id]-title [id]-desc"
>
  <title id="[id]-title">[Brief title]</title>
  <desc id="[id]-desc">[Longer description for screen readers]</desc>
  
  <defs>
    <!-- Gradients, filters, clipPaths, symbols -->
  </defs>
  
  <g id="[scene-name]">
    <!-- Grouped, animatable elements -->
  </g>
</svg>
```

### Animation-Ready Patterns
```css
/* Base state with will-change hint */
.anim-element {
  transform: translateY(0);
  opacity: 1;
  will-change: transform, opacity;
}

/* Entrance animation */
.anim-element.entering {
  animation: fade-up 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) forwards;
}

@keyframes fade-up {
  from {
    transform: translateY(20px);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

/* Reduced motion alternative */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .anim-element {
    animation: none !important;
    transition: none !important;
  }
}
```
