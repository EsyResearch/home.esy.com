   - A descriptive question (what/how)
   - An analytical question (why/how)
   - A comparative question
   - An evaluative question
   - A causal question

3. **Question Quality Assessment**
   For the top 2 questions:
   - Is it specific enough to answer well?
   - Is it significant enough to matter?
   - Is it feasible with available sources?
   - What type of evidence would answer it?

4. **Thesis Potential**
   For your recommended question:
   - What might a possible thesis look like?
   - What are the main areas of investigation?
   - What sources/evidence would you need?
