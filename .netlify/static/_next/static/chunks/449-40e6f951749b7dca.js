You'll need to have Node.js installed.","Open your terminal and run the installation command to get Claude Code globally available.","Once installed, navigate to your project directory and simply type 'claude' to start a session.","Claude Code automatically scans your project structure and understands the context.","This means you don't need to manually point it to files — it discovers them intelligently.","The key philosophy is: give clear, specific instructions about what you want to achieve.","For example, instead of saying 'fix the bug', describe the expected behavior versus actual behavior.","Claude Code excels at multi-file changes, refactoring, and implementing new features from scratch.","It can also run your tests, check linter errors, and iterate on fixes automatically.","One powerful pattern is to describe your desired architecture and let Claude Code scaffold it.","You can reference files, paste error messages, or describe UI changes you want to see.","Always review the changes Claude Code makes before committing — it's a pair programming partner.","The tool supports extended thinking for complex architectural decisions.","You can customize Claude Code's behavior with a CLAUDE.md file at your project root.","This file can contain project-specific instructions, coding standards, and preferences.","Think of CLAUDE.md as a living document that evolves with your project's conventions.","In this course, we'll go deep into each of these patterns with real-world examples.","By the end, you'll be using Claude Code to ship features 3-5x faster than manual coding.","Let's move on to the practical setup in the next segment.","First, ensure your environment meets the minimum requirements for running Claude Code.","You'll need Node.js 18 or later, a modern terminal, and at least 4GB of RAM available.","The installation process is straightforward and takes less than a minute.","After installation, verify everything works by running 'claude --version' in your terminal.","You should see the version number and a confirmation that the tool is ready.","Now let's look at the user interface. Claude Code presents a clean conversation interface.","You type your requests in natural language, and Claude responds with explanations and code changes.","The diff view shows you exactly what files were modified, added, or removed.","This transparency is crucial for maintaining control over your codebase.","Each change is presented as a clear diff that you can accept, reject, or modify.","Think of it like a code review where the reviewer also implements the suggestions.","This workflow dramatically reduces the back-and-forth typical of manual code reviews.","Now let's discuss some best practices for writing effective prompts for Claude Code.","The most important principle is specificity — be precise about what you want.","Include file paths, function names, and expected behavior in your requests.","Use examples when describing complex logic or UI patterns you want implemented.","Claude Code also supports multi-turn conversations, so you can iterate on results.","If the first result isn't perfect, provide feedback and ask for refinements.","That wraps up our introduction to Claude Code. In the next lesson, we'll dive into advanced patterns."]),s=o(["Welcome back! In this lesson we'll cover advanced patterns for Claude Code.","We're going to look at multi-file refactoring, test-driven development, and architecture scaffolding.","Let's start with multi-file refactoring — one of Claude Code's strongest capabilities.","Imagine you need to rename a component and update all its imports across 50 files.","Instead of find-and-replace, describe the refactoring goal and let Claude Code handle it.","It will find all usages, update imports, rename files, and adjust tests accordingly.","The key is to be explicit about what should change and what should stay the same.","For example: 'Rename UserProfile to AccountProfile everywhere, including tests and styles.'","Claude Code will generate a comprehensive diff showing every file that was modified.","Now let's talk about test-driven development with Claude Code.","You can write your test cases first, then ask Claude Code to implement the code that passes them.","This is incredibly powerful for maintaining code quality and catching edge cases.","Describe the function signature, the expected inputs and outputs, and the edge cases.","Claude Code will write both the implementation and verify it passes your tests.","Moving on to architecture scaffolding — creating entire features from a description.","You can describe a feature like 'Add a user settings page with email, password, and notification preferences.'","Claude Code will create the route, components, API endpoints, and database queries.","It follows your existing patterns, so the new code feels consistent with your codebase.","Another powerful pattern is iterative refinement through multi-turn conversations.","After Claude Code makes changes, you can say 'the styling needs more padding' or 'add error handling here.'","Each iteration builds on the previous context, so you don't need to repeat yourself.","This conversational approach makes complex tasks manageable and incremental.","Let's also discuss error recovery. When something goes wrong, Claude Code can help debug.","Paste an error message and describe the context. Claude Code will trace the issue and fix it.","It can also run your test suite and fix failing tests automatically.","This creates a tight feedback loop: describe → implement → test → fix → ship.","Now let's look at some real-world examples of these patterns in action.","In our demo project, we'll refactor an authentication system from JWT to session-based.","This involves changes to middleware, API routes, database schema, and client-side code.","Watch how Claude Code orchestrates all these changes in a single conversation.","The result is a clean, comprehensive refactoring with no manual file hunting.","That's the power of agentic coding — the AI handles the tedious parts while you direct the strategy.","In our final lesson, we'll cover tips for team workflows and CI/CD integration."]),n=o(["Welcome to the final lesson on Claude Code — team workflows and CI/CD integration.","So far we've covered individual usage, but Claude Code really shines in team settings.","Let's talk about how to standardize Claude Code usage across your engineering team.","The CLAUDE.md file we mentioned earlier becomes your team's AI coding constitution.","Document your coding standards, architecture decisions, and naming conventions in it.","When any team member uses Claude Code, it follows these shared conventions automatically.","This ensures consistency even when different developers are working on different features.","Next, let's discuss code review workflows with Claude Code.","You can use Claude Code to review pull requests by asking it to analyze the diff.","It can identify potential bugs, suggest improvements, and check for style consistency.","This doesn't replace human review — it augments it by catching mechanical issues.","Now let's look at CI/CD integration possibilities.","Claude Code can be used in automated pipelines for tasks like generating documentation.","It can also update changelogs, generate release notes, and update API documentation.","The key is to define clear, repeatable tasks that benefit from automation.","For deployment workflows, Claude Code can help prepare migration scripts and deploy configs.","Another team pattern is using Claude Code for onboarding new developers.","New team members can ask Claude Code questions about the codebase and get contextual answers.","Since Claude Code reads the actual code, the answers are specific to your project.","This dramatically reduces the time to productivity for new hires.","Let's also cover security considerations when using Claude Code in team settings.","Be mindful of sensitive data — don't include API keys or passwords in your prompts.","Use environment variables and secret management tools instead.","Configure your .gitignore to exclude any files that might contain sensitive information.","Now let's discuss measuring the impact of Claude Code on your team's productivity.","Track metrics like: time to first commit, PR review cycles, and bug fix turnaround.","Teams typically see a 40-60% reduction in time-to-ship after adopting AI coding tools.","But remember, the goal isn't just speed — it's sustainable, high-quality development.","Let's wrap up with some final best practices for long-term Claude Code usage.","Regularly update your CLAUDE.md as your project evolves and conventions change.","Share learnings with your team — what prompts work well, what doesn't.","Build a team library of common prompts for recurring tasks.","And most importantly, stay curious and experiment with new patterns.","Thanks for completing this course on Claude Code! You're now ready to code at 10x speed.","Check the resources section for links to documentation and community forums.","Happy coding, and see you in the next course!"]);o(["Welcome to ChatGPT for Research Workflows. In this course, we'll transform how you conduct research.","Traditional research involves hours of reading, note-taking, and synthesizing information.","ChatGPT can dramatically accelerate each of these stages when used strategically.","But let me be clear upfront — AI is a tool to augment your thinking, not replace it.","Critical evaluation of AI outputs is essential for maintaining research integrity.","Let's start with the research planning phase. This is where ChatGPT adds the most value.","You can use ChatGPT to brainstorm research questions and identify knowledge gaps.","Ask it to suggest alternative angles on your topic that you might not have considered.","For example: 'What are the underexplored aspects of climate adaptation in urban planning?'","ChatGPT can generate a structured research outline based on your initial questions.","This outline serves as a roadmap, helping you prioritize which sources to read first.","Now let's discuss using ChatGPT for literature review acceleration.","While ChatGPT can't read papers for you, it can help you quickly summarize and compare findings.","Paste an abstract and ask for a plain-language summary of the key contributions.","You can also ask it to identify the methodology, sample size, and limitations of a study.","This helps you quickly assess whether a paper is worth a deep read.","Another powerful technique is asking ChatGPT to compare multiple papers on the same topic.","Give it summaries of 3-4 papers and ask for a synthesis of their agreements and disagreements.","This creates a landscape view of the research field in minutes rather than hours.","Let's also cover citation management with ChatGPT assistance.","You can ask ChatGPT to format citations in any style — APA, MLA, Chicago, Harvard.","But always verify the citation details against the original source. AI can hallucinate DOIs.","Now let's talk about the writing phase. ChatGPT is excellent for overcoming writer's block.","Use it to generate first draft paragraphs that you then refine with your expert knowledge.","Ask it to rephrase complex ideas in simpler language for broader audiences.","Or conversely, help you express informal ideas in more academic language.","The key is to use ChatGPT as a writing partner, not a ghostwriter.","Your unique insights, analysis, and conclusions should always remain your own.","In the next lesson, we'll dive into specific prompt frameworks for different research stages.","These frameworks will give you a systematic approach to getting the best research outputs.","Thank you for joining this lesson. Let's continue building your AI research toolkit."]),o(["Welcome back! Today we're covering prompt frameworks specifically designed for research tasks.","A prompt framework is a reusable structure that consistently produces high-quality outputs.","The first framework is SCOPE: Situation, Context, Objective, Parameters, Examples.","Let me break each element down with a research-specific example.","Situation sets the scene: 'I am a graduate student researching urban heat islands.'","Context adds detail: 'I'm writing a literature review for my thesis proposal.'","Objective states the goal: 'Identify the top 5 mitigation strategies from recent studies.'","Parameters set constraints: 'Focus on studies from 2020-2024, peer-reviewed journals only.'","Examples show the format: 'Present each strategy with a one-paragraph summary and 3 key citations.'","When you combine all five elements, you get remarkably precise and useful outputs.","Let's try this framework live with a real research question.","The second framework is PEEL: Point, Evidence, Explain, Link. Familiar from academic writing.","You can use PEEL to structure ChatGPT's outputs in an academically rigorous format.","Ask ChatGPT: 'Using the PEEL structure, argue for the effectiveness of green roofs in reducing urban heat.'","The output will have a clear thesis, supporting evidence, analysis, and connection to broader themes.","The third framework is Socratic Dialogue — using questions to deepen analysis.","Instead of asking for answers, ask ChatGPT to challenge your arguments.","For example: 'Here is my thesis. Play devil's advocate and identify the three strongest counterarguments.'","This technique strengthens your research by exposing blind spots in your reasoning.","Now let's discuss chain prompting for complex research tasks.","Break your research into stages and feed the output of one prompt into the next.","Stage 1: 'Summarize this paper's methodology.' Stage 2: 'Compare this methodology with paper B.'","Stage 3: 'Synthesize the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches.'","This chain produces a nuanced comparison that a single prompt couldn't achieve.","Finally, let's cover the verification workflow — how to check AI outputs.","Always cross-reference facts, dates, and statistics with primary sources.","Use citation databases like Google Scholar to verify referenced papers actually exist.","Check for logical consistency — does the argument flow make sense?","And verify that direct quotes are accurate by finding them in the original text.","These verification habits are what separate responsible AI-assisted research from careless usage.","In our next lesson, we'll apply these frameworks to a complete research project from start to finish."]),o(["Welcome to our final lesson! Today we're doing a complete research project from start to finish.","We'll research the topic: 'The impact of remote work on urban planning in post-pandemic cities.'","I'll demonstrate every technique we've covered in this course, applied to a real project.","Let's start with the planning phase using the SCOPE framework.","First, we define our situation: we're writing a research brief for an urban planning conference.","Next, the context: post-COVID cities are seeing permanent shifts in commuting patterns.","Our objective: produce a 2000-word research brief with 10+ citations.","Parameters: focus on studies from 2021-2024, include data from at least 3 countries.","Now I'll use ChatGPT to brainstorm the key research questions.","Notice how I provide all five SCOPE elements in my prompt. The output is focused and relevant.","ChatGPT suggests looking at transportation infrastructure, housing markets, and commercial real estate.","It also suggests examining the equity implications — who benefits and who loses from remote work.","Excellent. Now let's move to the literature review acceleration phase.","I'll paste three abstracts and ask ChatGPT to synthesize the key findings.","Watch how I use chain prompting: first summarize, then compare, then synthesize.","The synthesis reveals a consensus that remote work reduces commute-related emissions.","But there's disagreement about the impact on suburban sprawl — some studies show increase, others decrease.","This is valuable — it tells us where the debate is and where our brief should focus.","Now let's use the Socratic Dialogue technique to stress-test our preliminary thesis.","Our thesis: 'Remote work fundamentally requires cities to rethink transit investment priorities.'","ChatGPT's counterarguments include: hybrid work may not reduce transit enough to matter.","And: transit serves essential workers who can't work remotely. Good points we need to address.","Now let's move to the writing phase. I'll use PEEL to structure the key sections.","For each section, I provide the point I want to make and ask for evidence and explanation.","I then refine the output with my own analysis and expert knowledge.","Notice I'm not using ChatGPT's text verbatim — I'm using it as a drafting accelerator.","The final step is verification. I check every citation ChatGPT suggested against Google Scholar.","Two out of ten citations needed correction — the papers existed but the details were slightly wrong.","This is why verification is non-negotiable in AI-assisted research.","Let's also run a consistency check: does our argument flow logically from start to finish?","ChatGPT confirms the structure is sound but suggests strengthening the equity section.","Good feedback. I'll add more data on how remote work impacts different income brackets.","And there we have it — a complete research brief, produced in hours instead of days.","The quality is high because we used frameworks, verification, and human expertise throughout.","Thank you for completing this course!

Test with color blindness simulators.","Typography matters too. Use no more than two font families in an infographic.","One for headings, one for body text. Keep text concise — every word should earn its place.","Icons and illustrations should be consistent in style. Don't mix flat and 3D graphics.","White space is your friend. Crowded infographics overwhelm rather than educate.","Give each section room to breathe. Margins and padding create visual hierarchy.","Let's also discuss the research behind effective visual learning.","Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning tells us that combining text and visuals helps.","But only when they're spatially and temporally aligned — text near its related graphic.","The split-attention effect occurs when readers must mentally integrate separated information.","Avoid this by placing labels directly on or near the data they describe.","In the next lesson, we'll use Nano Banana to create our first infographic from scratch.","You'll see how structured input produces professional-quality visual output."]),o(["Welcome back!
