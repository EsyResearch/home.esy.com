Four tines provided the ideal combination: pierce, scoop, lift, stabilize. The mathematics of eating had been solved.</p><p>With form perfected, the fork became a canvas for meaning. Etiquette codified its use—hold it <em>this</em> way, not <em>that</em> way. The Victorian era exploded with specialized forks: oyster forks, pickle forks, fish forks, ice cream forks, even terrapin forks for turtle dishes.</p></div></section><section class="fork-section " data-section-id="practical"><span class="section-era-badge">The Practical Stuff</span><h2 class="section-title">Your Fork Questions, Answered</h2><p class="section-subtitle">What you actually came here to know.</p><div class="section-content"><div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-question">Which fork is the salad fork?</div><div class="faq-answer-text">The <strong>smaller fork</strong>, placed to the <strong>left</strong> of the larger dinner fork.

The 19th century saw an explosion of specialized forks— each designed for a specific food. Fish forks have a notch for deboning. Salad forks are smaller to encourage modest portions. Dessert forks are delicate. Most of this was about displaying social knowledge, not genuine necessity.</div></div></div></section><section class="fork-section " data-section-id="global"><span class="section-era-badge">A Global Perspective</span><h2 class="section-title">Fork or No Fork</h2><p class="section-subtitle">The fork is one choice among many.</p><div class="section-content"><p>Here&#x27;s what the fork&#x27;s history teaches us: it&#x27;s not universal, and it doesn&#x27;t need to be.</p><p>A third of humanity eats with <span class="text-gold">chopsticks</span>—a technology older than the European fork, with its own philosophy. Another third eats with <span class="text-gold">hands</span>—not from lack of sophistication, but from cultural choice. Indian tradition holds that food is best experienced directly. Ethiopian cuisine builds eating into the social fabric—injera becomes utensil, sharing from a common plate bonds diners together.</p><p>The fork embodies Western values: individuality, hygiene anxiety, the separation of self from food. To eat with a fork is to hold the world at arm&#x27;s length.
