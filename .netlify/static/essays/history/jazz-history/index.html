Buddy Bolden, known as the first 'King' of jazz, organized his band around 1895, though no recordings of his music survive."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What was the first jazz recording?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The first commercial jazz recording was made on February 26, 1917, by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (ODJB), a white group, for Victor Records. However, jazz had existed for decades before this recording—Black musicians were systematically excluded from early recording opportunities."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Who are the most influential jazz musicians?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Key figures include Louis Armstrong, who revolutionized jazz with his Hot Five/Hot Seven recordings (1925-1928); Duke Ellington, who composed over 1,000 works; Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, who pioneered bebop; Miles Davis, who led multiple jazz movements; and John Coltrane, who brought spiritual dimension to modal jazz."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is bebop and when did it emerge?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bebop emerged in the early 1940s at venues like Minton's Playhouse in Harlem, pioneered by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk. It featured complex harmonies, virtuosic solos, and faster tempos, representing both an artistic revolution and a cultural assertion of Black artistic autonomy."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Was jazz really born in Storyville?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No—this is a common myth. Jazz developed throughout New Orleans, not specifically in Storyville (the red-light district). Scholar Bruce Boyd Raeburn of Tulane demonstrated that Storyville's closure in 1917 was 'essentially a non-event' for jazz. Musicians left New Orleans as part of the Great Migration, traveling primarily via the Illinois Central Railroad to Chicago."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is jazz dead?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Tokyo rivals New York as a jazz capital. Kamasi Washington's 'The Epic' (2015) proved the market for ambitious jazz. Esperanza Spalding won the Grammy for Best New Artist in 2011. Jazz at Lincoln Center has introduced the music to new audiences. Contemporary artists continue to innovate while honoring tradition."}}]}]}</script><main class="jazz-essay"><div class="staff-progress" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="0" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" aria-label="Reading progress"><div class="staff-lines"><div class="staff-line"></div><div class="staff-line"></div><div class="staff-line"></div><div class="staff-line"></div><div class="staff-line"></div></div><div class="staff-notes"><div class="staff-note " style="top:6.8%;left:10%" data-chapter="Prologue"></div><div class="staff-note " style="top:12.2%;left:25%" data-chapter="1.

Around 1905. New Orleans. A formal portrait: six men in a band, instruments in hand. Bolden holds his cornet, eyes steady. They called him King. He invented a sound that would become the foundational grammar of American music.</p><p>No one recorded it. No one wrote it down. By 1907, Bolden was committed to an asylum. He died there in 1931, having never heard a jazz record—not even his own, because none existed.</p><p>But the sound didn&#x27;t die. It multiplied. It traveled north on trains and spread across oceans. It became the swing that moved a nation and the bebop that bewildered it. It became cool and hard and free. It became America&#x27;s most original art form.</p><p>This is the story of that sound—how it was born in the collision of cultures, how it was stolen and reclaimed, how it died a thousand deaths and never stopped living.

French, Spanish, African, Caribbean, and American traditions collided in a cultural crucible that produced something unprecedented.</p><p>In Congo Square, enslaved Africans had been permitted to gather on Sundays, preserving rhythms and dances that would otherwise have been erased. After emancipation, these traditions merged with brass band music, blues, and European harmonies. Creole musicians, trained in European classical tradition, found themselves sharing stages with uptown Black musicians who played by ear.</p><p>It was in this collision that jazz was born—not in Storyville, as the myth would have it, but throughout New Orleans. In parks and parades. At funerals and celebrations. In dance halls where the distinction between Creole and Black, between written and improvised, between European and African, dissolved into something new.</p><p>Buddy Bolden stood at the center of this transformation. He rearranged the New Orleans dance band to accommodate the blues, creating a &#x27;wide open&#x27; sound that could be heard across town. He never recorded. He never wrote down his arrangements.

The finest jazz musicians in the world played for crowds who would not have dined beside them.</p><p>Duke Ellington&#x27;s orchestra became the house band in 1927. His radio broadcasts from the Cotton Club brought jazz to millions—the first time many white Americans heard this music. But the club&#x27;s jungle-themed decor and segregated seating made visible the exploitation at the heart of mainstream jazz success.</p><p>Yet jazz found ways to subvert. The Savoy Ballroom, also in Harlem, was genuinely integrated—the only major ballroom where Black and white dancers shared the floor. Benny Goodman integrated his groups, hiring Teddy Wilson (1935) and Lionel Hampton (1936) for what were among the first racially integrated major American bands.</p><p>On January 16, 1938, Goodman played Carnegie Hall—&#x27;jazz&#x27;s coming out party,&#x27; they called it.

Three days after Woodstock, Miles Davis entered Columbia&#x27;s Studio B.

It was the first jazz album to sell a million copies in the United States. Davis played the Fillmore East, opening for rock bands. He played the Isle of Wight Festival to 600,000 people.</p><p>Jazz purists called it betrayal. Stanley Crouch named Davis &#x27;the most brilliant sellout in the history of jazz.&#x27; But the musicians who had played with Davis—Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul—heard possibility.</p><p>Weather Report. Return to Forever. Mahavishnu Orchestra. Head Hunters. These weren&#x27;t jazz albums with electric instruments. They were new music, born from jazz&#x27;s improvisational DNA but living in a different body.

Teo Macero&#x27;s tape splicing on &#x27;Bitches Brew&#x27; predated sampling. The Fender Rhodes gave pianists new timbres. The Minimoog let Jan Hammer bend notes like a horn player.

Jazz developed throughout New Orleans, not specifically in Storyville (the red-light district).
