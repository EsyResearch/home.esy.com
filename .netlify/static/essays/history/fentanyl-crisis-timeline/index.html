Its potency and rapid onset made it valuable in controlled hospital settings, where precise dosing and immediate effect were advantages.</p><p>Synthetic opioids behave differently than plant-based opioids in several consequential ways. They do not require agricultural land, seasonal cultivation, or extensive supply chains. They can be manufactured in small facilities with precursor chemicals. A kilogram of fentanyl has the pharmacological equivalent of roughly 50 kilograms of heroin. These characteristics—compactness, potency, and independence from agriculture—would later prove significant.</p><p>This timeline traces how fentanyl moved through distinct phases: from a legitimate pharmaceutical achievement, through the expansion of pain management, into illicit markets, and finally to its current position as the dominant opioid in the American drug supply.</p></div></section><nav class="ft-timeline-nav" aria-label="Timeline navigation"><div class="ft-timeline-nav-inner"><button class="ft-timeline-nav-item active" aria-current="true"><span class="ft-timeline-nav-year">1959–70</span></button><button class="ft-timeline-nav-item "><span class="ft-timeline-nav-year">1980s–90s</span></button><button class="ft-timeline-nav-item "><span class="ft-timeline-nav-year">2000–10</span></button><button class="ft-timeline-nav-item "><span class="ft-timeline-nav-year">2013–16</span></button><button class="ft-timeline-nav-item "><span class="ft-timeline-nav-year">2017–19</span></button><button class="ft-timeline-nav-item "><span class="ft-timeline-nav-year">2020–22</span></button><button class="ft-timeline-nav-item "><span class="ft-timeline-nav-year">2023–</span></button></div></nav><section id="era-laboratory" class="ft-era" data-era="laboratory"><div class="ft-era-marker" aria-hidden="true"></div><header class="ft-era-header"><p class="ft-era-years">1959–1970</p><h2 class="ft-era-title">Laboratory Success</h2></header><div class="ft-prose"><p>In 1960, Paul Janssen synthesized fentanyl at Janssen Pharmaceutica in Beerse, Belgium. Janssen was searching for more potent analgesics with better pharmacological profiles than existing options. Fentanyl emerged from this research as a compound with rapid onset, short duration, and exceptional potency.</p><p>The medical rationale for potency was straightforward. In surgical anesthesia, a drug that works quickly and clears quickly allows for precise control. The patient can be brought to the required depth of anesthesia and returned to consciousness in a predictable window. Potency meant smaller doses, which meant less total drug in the system.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved fentanyl (marketed as Sublimaze) for intravenous use in 1968. Its adoption in surgical settings was rapid. Anesthesiologists valued its controllability. Hospitals integrated it into standard protocols.</p><div class="ft-stat"><span class="ft-stat-number">50–100×</span><span class="ft-stat-label">more potent than morphine</span><span class="ft-stat-source">NIDA</span></div><p>At this stage, fentanyl existed almost exclusively in hospital settings under direct medical supervision.

A growing body of advocacy argued that chronic pain was undertreated, that physicians were too hesitant to prescribe adequate pain relief, and that this represented a failure of care.</p><p>In 1990, the American Pain Society launched its campaign to make pain the &quot;fifth vital sign.&quot; The Joint Commission subsequently incorporated pain assessment into its accreditation standards. Hospitals and physicians faced institutional pressure to treat pain more aggressively.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies responded. In 1991, the FDA approved Duragesic, the first transdermal fentanyl patch. This was a significant step: fentanyl could now be used outside hospital settings, prescribed for chronic pain management and administered at home.</p><p>In 1998, Actiq—an oral fentanyl lozenge—received approval for breakthrough cancer pain. The drug was moving from surgical suites to medicine cabinets.</p><p>Early warning signs appeared in this period. California saw deaths from &quot;China White,&quot; an illicit fentanyl analog, in the 1980s. Some diversion from medical settings was documented. But these incidents remained limited and contained. The larger crisis would come from a different direction.</p></div><div class="ft-causal"><p class="ft-causal-label">Transition</p><p class="ft-causal-text">The expansion of legitimate fentanyl products created familiarity with the drug.

OxyContin, approved in 1995 and aggressively marketed, drove a dramatic expansion in opioid prescribing. By the mid-2000s, the consequences were becoming clear: widespread addiction, overdose deaths, and communities devastated by dependence.</p><p>In 2007, Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty to misbranding OxyContin and paid a $600 million fine. This marked the beginning of regulatory reckoning. States tightened prescription monitoring. Physicians faced increased scrutiny.</p><p>In 2010, Purdue reformulated OxyContin to make it harder to crush and abuse. The new formulation was difficult to snort or inject. This was a public health intervention with an unintended consequence: it created demand displacement. Users dependent on prescription opioids needed alternatives.</p><p>Fentanyl was not the primary driver of this era. Prescription fentanyl patches saw some diversion, but illicitly manufactured fentanyl remained rare. The infrastructure did not yet exist.</p><p>The prescription opioid crisis created a population of dependent users. When their supply was restricted, they did not stop using.

Synthetic opioids now accounted for 48% of all overdose deaths.</p><p>A new phenomenon emerged: mixing. Fentanyl began appearing in drugs sold as cocaine. It appeared in methamphetamine. Users were consuming fentanyl without knowing it, without tolerance to opioids, without understanding why they were overdosing.</p><p>Four factors explain why fentanyl deaths scale faster than heroin deaths:</p><p><strong>Inconsistent dosing.</strong> Street drugs vary wildly in fentanyl concentration. A batch that is survivable one day may be lethal the next.</p><p><strong>No tolerance calibration.</strong> Users cannot gauge a safe dose.

Fentanyl was no longer displacing heroin; it had replaced it. Users seeking opioids now expected fentanyl, not heroin.

Following increased regulation of fentanyl precursors in China in 2019, production shifted to alternative precursor chemicals. Supply chains adapted. Decentralized pressing operations—where fentanyl powder is pressed into counterfeit pills—operate within the United States.</p><p>Policy responses remain divided between two frameworks.

It represents a structural shift in how synthetic drugs can be produced, distributed, and entrenched in illicit markets.</p><p>Synthetic opioids are uniquely difficult to contain for reasons that are now clear: they do not require agricultural production, they can be manufactured in small facilities, their potency means small shipments carry enormous value, and once established, the economic incentives favor their persistence over less potent alternatives.</p><p>The timeline from hospital anesthetic to dominant street opioid spans six decades. It moved through legitimate medicine, through the expansion of pain treatment, through regulatory response to prescription opioids, through the economics of illicit supply, through a pandemic that disrupted treatment while favoring synthetic distribution.</p><p>At each transition, the next phase followed from conditions established in the prior phase. The trajectory was not random. It was not inevitable in every detail.
