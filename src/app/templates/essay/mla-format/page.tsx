Fitzgerald uses color symbolically, noting that Gatsby's dream was "a green light" that represented hope (180).

Long Quote (4+ lines):
      The narrator describes the scene in detail:
              Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future 
              that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, 
              but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, 
              stretch out our arms farther. (180)
      This passage reveals Gatsby's persistent optimism despite evidence of failure.
