    <p>
      A <strong>research essay</strong> demonstrates your ability to investigate a topic, evaluate sources 
      critically, and synthesize information into a coherent argument. Unlike simpler essays, research papers 
      require engagement with scholarly sources and often contribute new analysis or perspectives to academic 
      conversations.

      This template provides the standard structure for academic research papers across most disciplines.

Context: Provide background information that situates your research within the broader field or conversation.

Research Gap or Problem: Identify what's missing in current understanding or what problem needs addressing.

Thesis Statement: Present your central argument or the main finding your research will demonstrate.

Roadmap (optional): Briefly preview the structure of your paper.

Tip: Your introduction should move from broad context to your specific contribution—like a funnel.`,

Organization Options:
• Chronological: Trace how understanding has evolved
• Thematic: Group sources by subtopic or approach
• Methodological: Compare different research methods used

For Each Source/Group:
• Summarize key findings or arguments
• Analyze strengths and limitations
• Show how it connects to your research question

Synthesis: Don't just summarize sources individually—show how they relate to each other and where gaps exist.

End by clearly identifying the gap your research fills.`,

For Each Section:
• Present evidence (data, quotes, examples)
• Analyze what the evidence shows
• Connect findings to your thesis

Significance: Explain why your research matters—what does it contribute?

Future directions: Suggest what research should come next.

Final thought: End with a memorable statement about the broader implications.
