    <p>
      <strong>Argumentative essays</strong> are the backbone of academic writing. They require you to 
      investigate a topic, collect and evaluate evidence, and establish a position on the topic in a 
      concise manner. Unlike expository essays which simply inform, argumentative essays demand that 
      you take a clear stance and defend it.
