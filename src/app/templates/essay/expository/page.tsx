  seoIntro: `
    <p>
      <strong>Expository writing</strong> is about explanation, not persuasion. Your goal is to help 
      readers understand a topic clearly, presenting information in a logical, well-organized manner. 
      This is one of the most commonly assigned essay types in high school and introductory college courses.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      Unlike argumentative essays that take a stance, expository essays inform and explain. You'll 
      present facts, definitions, examples, and analysis—but the aim is clarity and understanding, 
      not convincing readers of your opinion.
