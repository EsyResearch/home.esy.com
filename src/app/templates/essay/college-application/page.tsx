    <p>
      Your <strong>college application essay</strong> is one of the few places where you control the narrative. 
      While your transcript shows what you've accomplished, your essay shows <em>who you are</em>—your values, 
      your thinking, and what matters to you.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      This template follows the structure that works for Common App essays, Coalition essays, and most 
      school-specific prompts. The key isn't following a formula—it's finding an authentic story that 
      reveals something meaningful about you. Our outline and prompts help you discover and tell that story.

      wordCount: '50-75 words',
      content: `Start in the middle of a specific moment. Don't begin with generic statements ("I've always loved..." or "Ever since I was young...").

Techniques that work:
• Drop the reader into a scene with sensory details
• Start with dialogue
• Begin with a surprising statement or contradiction
• Open with a moment of tension or decision

Example: Instead of "I've always been interested in medicine," try "The first time I held a human heart, my hands didn't shake."`,

      title: 'II. Context & Stakes',
      wordCount: '75-100 words',
      content: `After hooking the reader, zoom out briefly to provide context.

What to include:
• Why this moment/experience mattered
• What was at stake for you
• Any relevant background the reader needs
• The challenge or question you faced

Keep this section brief—you want to get to the meat of your story quickly. The reader should understand the situation but still be curious about what happens next.`,

      wordCount: '200-250 words',
      content: `This is the heart of your essay. Show what happened AND what you thought/felt.

Structure:
• Describe key moments with specific details (not summaries)
• Include your internal dialogue—what were you thinking?
• Show your actions and decisions
• Weave in reflection naturally, don't save it all for the end

The best essays move between scene (showing) and reflection (telling). Don't just narrate events—reveal how you processed them.

Avoid: Listing accomplishments, summarizing activities, or telling readers what to think about you.`,

      wordCount: '100-125 words',

Elements of a strong turn:
• A realization or shift in perspective
• How your understanding deepened
• What you do differently now
• The values or qualities this revealed

This should feel earned by the story you've told, not tacked on. The insight should be specific to YOUR experience, not a generic life lesson everyone already knows.

Weak: "I learned that hard work pays off."
Strong: "I realized that my fear of disappointing my grandmother had been driving my choices—and that I needed to find my own reasons."`,

      title: 'V. The Landing — Forward Look',
      wordCount: '50-75 words',

Strong endings:
• Circle back to your opening image/scene with new meaning
• Show how this shapes what you want to study or do
• Hint at future impact without being grandiose
• End with a memorable line that captures your essence

Don't: Summarize your essay, make promises about what you'll do in college, or end with clichés ("I can't wait to see what the future holds").`,

   - A polished version of the essay
   - Track changes notes explaining significant edits
