      <h2>Recommended client ladder</h2>
      <p>
        This is the pattern os.esy.com ships — copy it rather than reinventing it. The worst case
        at every rung is plain polling, never a broken UI:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Paint fast, then stream.</strong> Fire a normal <code>GET /v1/runs/{'{id}'}</code>{' '}
          immediately (renders in one round-trip) while the SSE handshake runs in parallel; let the
          snapshot replace state when it arrives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>On stream error</strong>, close the socket, make one authenticated GET through
          your regular HTTP client — it refreshes an expired session (EventSource can&apos;t) and
          resyncs state — then reconnect with 1s → 8s backoff.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>After ~4 consecutive failures</strong>, fall back to polling the GET every ~2s
          and quietly retry the stream every ~30s.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>On a terminal event</strong>, do one final GET (the priced cost ledger and
          server-computed timings land there), then close.
        </li>
      </ol>

          <code>/v1/ai/completions</code> also streams — but that stream is the <em>tokens of one

          watching a generation finish, you want Run Events.
