/**
 * Homepage - Template-Driven Research Workflows
 * 
 * Strategic positioning: Esy as a template-driven research platform
 * where you choose a template, provide sources, and get publish-ready artifacts.
 * 
 * Key messaging:
 * - "Choose a template. Get a publishable artifact."
 * - Quality gates ensure defensibility
 * - Templates as the entry point
 * - Visual essays and artifacts as proof of the method
 * 
 * Visual language:
 * - Circuit board / node graph aesthetic
 * - Intelligence flows through quality gates
 * - Editorial sophistication meets systems thinking
 *
