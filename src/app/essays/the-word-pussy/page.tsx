            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The original meaning was simply 'cat.' The word appeared in English by the 1500s, likely from Dutch 'poes' or Low German 'puse,' both affectionate names for cats. 'Puss' and 'pussy' were innocent pet-names for centuries—appearing in nursery rhymes and children's stories."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The vulgar meaning developed gradually from the 17th century onward. By the 1800s, 'pussy' was recorded as slang for female genitalia, likely through metaphorical association with softness and fur. The double meaning made the word increasingly awkward, eventually overwhelming the original cat sense."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The euphemism treadmill is a linguistic phenomenon where words created to be polite alternatives eventually absorb the taboo of what they replace. 'Pussy' followed this path—starting as an innocent pet-name, becoming a euphemism, then becoming the new taboo term itself."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "No. 'Pussycat' (coward) and 'pusillanimous' (cowardly) are false cognates with different origins. Pusillanimous comes from Latin 'pusillus' (very small) + 'animus' (spirit). The similarity is coincidental, though 'pussy' meaning coward may have been influenced by the perceived timidity of cats."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "As the vulgar meaning became dominant in the late 20th century, the innocent 'pussycat' became unusable in children's contexts. Classic rhymes like 'Pussycat, Pussycat, where have you been?' became awkward. This is an example of how semantic change can permanently alter a word's usability."

            "text": "The word demonstrates several linguistic principles: semantic drift (meaning change over time), the euphemism treadmill, pejoration (becoming more negative), and taboo contamination. A word's fate is shaped by cultural attitudes, not just dictionary definitions. Meaning lives in use, not etymology."
