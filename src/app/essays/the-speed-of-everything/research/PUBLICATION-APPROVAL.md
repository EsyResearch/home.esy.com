## Director Notes

"The Speed of Everything" is a compelling conceptual essay that takes readers on a logarithmic journey through velocity — from the imperceptible creep of continents to the speed of light. The essay features 6 interactive visualizations built with Framer Motion and React, all backed by verified Tier 1 scientific data. The cosmic blue-to-yellow design palette effectively reinforces the thematic journey from slow to fast. The essay is approved for publication.
