# Common Misconceptions: The Speed of Everything

> **Purpose**: Identify and address misconceptions the reader likely holds, so the essay can preemptively correct them.

## 1. "Nothing can go faster than light"

**The misconception**: The speed of light is the absolute maximum speed of anything.

**The nuance**: The speed of light is the maximum speed of *information* and *causality* through space. However:
- The expansion of space itself can cause distant galaxies to recede faster than c
- Phase velocity of waves can exceed c (but carries no information)
- Quantum entanglement correlations are instantaneous but cannot transmit information

**How to address**: Present c as the speed limit of *causality and information*, not of all phenomena. Mention space expansion as a teaser, not a deep dive.

## 2. "The speed of sound is a fixed number"

**The misconception**: Sound always travels at 343 m/s.

**The reality**: 343 m/s is only for dry air at 20°C at sea level. The speed of sound varies dramatically by medium:
- Water: ~1,480 m/s (4.3× faster)
- Steel: ~5,960 m/s (17× faster)
- Diamond: ~12,000 m/s (35× faster)

**How to address**: Use this as a teaching moment about medium-dependence. It's a good setup for "even c depends on the medium — light slows in glass and water."

## 3. "We're sitting still right now"

**The misconception**: If you're not moving relative to the ground, you're not moving.

**The reality**: You're simultaneously moving at 465 m/s (rotation), 29,800 m/s (orbit), 220,000 m/s (galactic orbit), and ~370,000 m/s (relative to CMB). There is no absolute rest frame.

**How to address**: This is one of the essay's strongest "aha" moments. Build to it in the cosmic speeds section. The reveal should feel like vertigo.

## 4. "Faster = more dangerous"

**The misconception**: Speed itself is dangerous.

**The reality**: *Change* in speed (acceleration/deceleration) is what's dangerous. An astronaut on the ISS at 7,660 m/s is perfectly comfortable. A car crash at 13 m/s (30 mph) can be fatal. It's the sudden deceleration that kills.

**How to address**: Brief aside when discussing ISS orbital speed. Reinforces the relative motion concept.

## 5. "Continental drift is too slow to matter"

**The misconception**: At 2.5 cm/year, plate tectonics is negligible.

**The reality**: Over 200 million years, 2.5 cm/year adds up to 5,000 km — enough to rearrange entire continents, open and close oceans, and reshape global climate. Slow doesn't mean unimportant — it means patient.

**How to address**: Use the time-lapse framing. "If you fast-forwarded Earth by 100 million years, the continents would be unrecognizable."

## 6. "Light is instantaneous"

**The misconception**: Light arrives the moment it's emitted.

**The reality**: Light takes 1.3 seconds to reach the Moon, 8 min 20 sec to reach Earth from the Sun, and 4.3 years to reach the nearest star. At cosmic scales, light is frustratingly slow.

**How to address**: The light-delay conversation analogy (see ANALOGIES.md #5) lands this beautifully. The Sun you see is always 8 minutes old.

## 7. "Logarithmic scales are misleading"

**The misconception**: Using a log scale is a way to make data look more dramatic than it is.

**The reality**: For data spanning many orders of magnitude, a linear scale is the one that's misleading — it compresses 99.99% of the data into an invisible sliver at the origin. Log scales reveal structure that linear scales hide.

**How to address**: Address directly when introducing the logarithmic ruler visualization. Show the same data on both linear and log scales to demonstrate why log is necessary.
