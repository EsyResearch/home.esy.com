## Human Speed Range in Context

- Humans directly experience speeds from ~0 to ~31 m/s (sitting still to highway driving)
- That's roughly 1.5 orders of magnitude
- The full natural speed spectrum spans ~17 orders of magnitude
- **Humans perceive less than 9% of the speed spectrum** (by orders of magnitude)
