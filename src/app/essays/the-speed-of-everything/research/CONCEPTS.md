# Core Concepts: The Speed of Everything

> **Purpose**: Define the key concepts readers must understand, in order of introduction.

## 1. Speed vs. Velocity

- **Speed**: Scalar quantity — magnitude only (how fast)
- **Velocity**: Vector quantity — magnitude + direction (how fast and which way)
- **For this essay**: We use "speed" throughout since direction is not the focus. This is technically correct — we're comparing magnitudes.

## 2. Orders of Magnitude

- A way to express the approximate size of a number by powers of 10
- Continental drift (~10⁻⁹ m/s) vs. speed of light (~10⁸ m/s) = **17 orders of magnitude apart**
- Key insight: most of the "interesting" universe happens outside the narrow band humans can directly perceive

## 3. Logarithmic Scale

- A scale where each equal interval represents a multiplication (not addition)
- Linear scale: 0, 10, 20, 30... (each step +10)
- Logarithmic scale: 1, 10, 100, 1000... (each step ×10)
- **Why essential here**: The only way to meaningfully place 10⁻⁹ and 10⁸ on the same axis
- **Reader analogy**: Like the Richter scale for earthquakes — each number is 10× more powerful

## 4. The Speed of Light as a Universal Constant

- Not just "very fast" — it's the speed limit of causality itself
- Since 1983, the metre is *defined* by the speed of light: 1 metre = distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second
- Nothing with mass can reach c; approaching it requires infinite energy
- Electromagnetic radiation (light, radio, X-rays) all travel at c in vacuum

## 5. Mach Numbers

- Mach 1 = speed of sound in the local medium
- Named after Ernst Mach (Austrian physicist, 1838–1916)
- Mach number depends on medium: Mach 1 in air ≈ 343 m/s, but Mach 1 in water ≈ 1,480 m/s
- Commonly used for aircraft speeds — provides intuitive "how many times the speed of sound" framing

## 6. Relative Motion

- All speed is relative — there is no absolute rest frame
- You are currently moving at ~465 m/s (Earth rotation) + ~29,800 m/s (Earth orbit) + ~220,000 m/s (galactic orbit) + ~370,000 m/s (relative to CMB)
- These velocities "stack" — but we don't feel them because there's no acceleration
- **Key insight for the essay**: "How fast am I going?" has no single answer without a reference frame

## 7. Terminal Velocity

- Maximum speed an object reaches when gravitational acceleration equals air resistance
- Human body: ~55 m/s (belly-down) to ~90 m/s (head-down dive)
- A useful speed benchmark that connects gravity, aerodynamics, and human experience

## 8. Escape Velocity

- Minimum speed to escape a gravitational field without further propulsion
- Earth: 11,186 m/s (~40,270 km/h)
- A natural dividing line: below this, you're bound to Earth; above, you're free
- ISS orbits at 7,660 m/s — below escape velocity, hence it stays in orbit
