# Key Definitions: The Speed of Everything

> **Purpose**: Precise definitions of terms the essay introduces to the reader.

---

## Speed
The rate at which an object covers distance. A scalar quantity (magnitude only). SI unit: metres per second (m/s).

## Velocity
Speed with a direction. A vector quantity. Example: "30 m/s northward" is a velocity; "30 m/s" is a speed.

## Metre per second (m/s)
The SI base unit of speed. All speeds in this essay are normalized to m/s for direct comparison. Conversions: 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h = 2.237 mph.

## Order of Magnitude
A factor of 10. Two quantities differ by "one order of magnitude" if one is approximately 10× the other. Continental drift (~10⁻⁹ m/s) and light (~10⁸ m/s) differ by ~17 orders of magnitude.

## Logarithmic Scale
A scale of measurement that uses the logarithm of a physical quantity instead of the quantity itself. On a log₁₀ scale, the distance between 1 and 10 is the same as between 10 and 100, or between 1,000 and 10,000.

## c (Speed of Light)
The speed of electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum: exactly 299,792,458 m/s. Since 1983, the metre is defined in terms of c. It is the maximum speed at which information or energy can travel through space.

## Mach Number
The ratio of an object's speed to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium. Mach 1 = speed of sound. Named after physicist Ernst Mach (1838–1916). Medium-dependent: Mach 1 in air at sea level ≈ 343 m/s.

## Escape Velocity
The minimum speed an object must have to escape a gravitational field without further propulsion. For Earth: 11,186 m/s. Depends on the mass of the body and distance from its center.

## Terminal Velocity
The maximum speed an object reaches while falling through a fluid (usually air), when gravitational force equals drag force. For a human body: ~55 m/s (spread-eagle) to ~90 m/s (streamlined).

## Light-Year
The distance light travels in one year: ~9.461 × 10¹² km. Not a unit of time — a unit of distance. Used because cosmic distances are too large for kilometers.

## Reference Frame
A coordinate system relative to which motion is described. There is no absolute reference frame — all motion is relative. Your speed depends on what you measure it against.

## Tectonic Plate
A massive slab of Earth's lithosphere that moves, floats, and sometimes fractures. Their motion, measured by GPS, averages 1–10 cm/year.

## Signal Propagation Speed
The speed at which a signal (electrical, optical, or acoustic) travels through a medium. In copper wire: ~2/3 c. In fiber optic cable: ~2/3 c. In neurons: 1–120 m/s.
