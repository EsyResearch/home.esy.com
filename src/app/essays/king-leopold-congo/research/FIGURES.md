## 20. Mulumba Nkusu (M'lumba)

**Full Name**: Mulumba Nkusu
**Dates**: Active 1899
**Role**: Zappo Zap leader

### The 1899 Massacre
In 1899, colonial officer Dufour ordered Zappo Zap forces to collect rubber taxes from the Kuba Kingdom. Mulumba Nkusu led approximately 500 armed warriors to the Pyang region where they:
- Built a stockade and summoned local chiefs
- Demanded 60 slaves, herds of goats, food baskets, and 2,500 balls of rubber
- Massacred chiefs when tribute was refused
- Destroyed at least 14 villages
- Killed, looted, and practiced cannibalism

### William Sheppard's Investigation
Sheppard documented the massacre on September 14-15, 1899, obtaining Mulumba's own testimony through casual questioning. Sheppard observed:
- 40+ corpses, some hanging from trees
- Evidence of cannibalism
- 81 severed right hands being dried
- 60 women confined as hostages and sex slaves

### Aftermath
Mulumba was arrested after missionary protests. He expressed confusion, saying "he had only done what was asked of him."

## Notes on Congolese Voice and Agency

### Challenge
The historical record of the Congo Free State is dominated by European sources - consuls, missionaries, reformers. Congolese voices are largely mediated through these external observers.

### Documented Congolese Agency
1. **Nsala** - Chose to be photographed, providing testimony
2. **Gongo Lutete** - Led resistance, switched allegiances strategically
3. **Batetela soldiers** - Mutinied against colonial authority
4. **Unnamed witnesses** - Provided testimony to Casement (370 statements to Belgian Commission)
5. **Village resistance** - Documented refusals to meet rubber quotas

### Scholarly Resources for Congolese Perspectives
- Adam Hochschild, *King Leopold's Ghost* (1998)
- Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja, *The Congo from Leopold to Kabila* (2002)
- David Van Reybrouck, *Congo: The Epic History of a People* (2014)
- Isidore Ndaywel e Nziem, *Histoire generale du Congo* (1998)

### Recommendation
When developing essay content, emphasize Congolese agency wherever documented. The reform movement succeeded partly because Congolese people testified, fled, resisted, and preserved memory of atrocities.
