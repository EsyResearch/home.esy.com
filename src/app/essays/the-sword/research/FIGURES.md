### Muramasa Sengo (16th century)
**Role**: Japanese swordsmith, Muromachi period  
**Historical Status**: ✅ Verified — controversial historical figure

**Biographical Summary**:
Muramasa Sengo was a swordsmith active in the 16th century, known for producing exceptionally sharp blades. His swords gained a reputation as "cursed" or "bloodthirsty" after several incidents involving the Tokugawa family, leading to their suppression during the Edo period.

**Key Contributions**:
- Known for extremely sharp, aggressive cutting ability
- His blades were said to have violent temperaments
- The "curse" legend elevated his historical significance

**Cultural Context**:
The Tokugawa shogunate discouraged ownership of Muramasa blades after several family members were killed by them (likely coincidence). This made them symbols of rebellion and attracted collectors despite (or because of) the ban.

**Imagery Sources**:
- Surviving blades in museum collections
- Edo-period artwork depicting Muramasa and his "cursed" reputation
- Modern photographs of authenticated Muramasa blades

**Quotable Material**:
No verified quotes survive. The legendary reputation speaks through cultural stories rather than documented words.
