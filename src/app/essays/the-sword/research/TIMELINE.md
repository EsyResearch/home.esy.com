## Bronze Age (c. 3000-1200 BCE)

### c. 3000 BCE — First Bronze Swords
**Region**: Mesopotamia, Aegean, Eastern Mediterranean  
**Development**: Bronze casting techniques enable production of swords (longer than daggers)  
**Limitations**: Bronze is relatively soft; early swords are short (50-70cm) to prevent bending  
**Sources**: Archaeological evidence from Mesopotamian and Minoan sites; British Museum collection  
**Significance**: Sword emerges as distinct weapon type, requiring specialized metallurgy

### c. 2500 BCE — Bronze Sword Proliferation
**Region**: Egypt, Mesopotamia, Indus Valley  
**Development**: Bronze swords become standard military equipment for elite warriors  
**Cultural Context**: Swords as status symbols — expensive to produce, markers of warrior class  
**Sources**: Tomb finds (Egyptian pharaohs, Mesopotamian rulers)  
**Significance**: Sword begins dual role as weapon and symbol of power

### c. 1600-1200 BCE — Late Bronze Age Peak
**Region**: Mycenaean Greece, Hittite Anatolia, New Kingdom Egypt  
**Development**: Improved bronze alloys, longer blades (70-90cm), refined designs  
**Military Context**: Bronze Age warfare — chariot battles, infantry combat  
**Notable Examples**: Naue II sword type (Central Europe) — precursor to iron swords  
**Sources**: Archaeological sites (Mycenae, Hattusa), museum collections  
**Significance**: Bronze sword technology reaches peak before iron transition

## Iron Age (c. 1200 BCE-500 CE)

### c. 1200-1000 BCE — Iron Age Transition
**Region**: Near East, Anatolia, spreading to Europe and Asia  
**Development**: Iron smelting technology enables iron sword production  
**Advantages**: Iron more abundant than copper/tin; can be work-hardened  
**Challenges**: Early iron softer than good bronze; requires carburization (adding carbon)  
**Sources**: Archaeological evidence of iron-working sites  
**Significance**: Democratization of sword ownership — iron more accessible than bronze

### c. 500 BCE — Steel Production Emerges
**Region**: India, China, independently in multiple locations  
**Development**: Controlled carburization produces steel (iron with carbon content)  
**Technologies**: Crucible steel (India), cast iron techniques (China)  
**Sources**: Archaeological metallurgy, historical texts (Chinese records)  
**Significance**: Steel's superior properties make it ideal for sword blades

### c. 200 BCE-200 CE — Pattern-Welding Developed
**Region**: Celtic and Germanic Europe  
**Development**: Forge-welding iron/steel rods of different carbon content creates composite blades  
**Advantages**: Hard edges with tough cores; distinctive visual patterns  
**Sources**: Davidson, "The Sword in Anglo-Saxon England"; British Museum collection  
**Significance**: Sophisticated metallurgy produces superior blades; patterns become aesthetic feature

### c. 200 BCE-200 CE — Chinese Sword Traditions Flourish
**Region**: Han Dynasty China  
**Development**: Jian (straight double-edged sword) refined; sophisticated metallurgy  
**Cultural Context**: Swords in Confucian philosophy, martial arts development  
**Sources**: National Palace Museum collection; "Records of the Grand Historian"
