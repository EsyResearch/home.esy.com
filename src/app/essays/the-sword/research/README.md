## Research Methodology

### Domain Detection
**Detected Domains**: History + Cultural Studies + Materials Science  
**Lenses Applied**:
- Historical methodology (primary/secondary source distinction)
- Cultural context (symbolism, ceremony, identity)
- Technical accuracy (metallurgy, materials science)
- Cross-cultural comparison (avoiding Eurocentrism)

### Source Selection Criteria
1. **Primary sources prioritized**: Museum artifacts, historical texts, manuscripts
2. **Scholarly secondary sources**: Peer-reviewed research, academic monographs
3. **Technical accuracy**: Metallurgical research from materials scientists
4. **Cultural authenticity**: Regional experts and primary texts for cultural claims
5. **Visual documentation**: All major claims supported by physical artifacts

### Cross-Cultural Balance
Deliberate effort to represent multiple traditions:
- Japanese traditions: 5 sources
- Middle Eastern traditions: 3 sources
- Chinese traditions: 2 sources
- European traditions: 8 sources
- Global/comparative: 4 sources

### Verification Process
1. **URL verification**: All online sources accessed and confirmed functional
2. **Quote authentication**: Quotes traced to specific sources or marked as attributed
3. **Cross-referencing**: Major claims supported by multiple independent sources
4. **Gap documentation**: Unsupported claims documented and excluded

## Usage Guide for Production

### For Writers (G5 Production)
1. **Start with SYNTHESIS.md**: Narrative arc, themes, metaphors
2. **Reference CLAIMS.md**: Verify every factual statement traces to documented claim
3. **Use FIGURES.md**: Biographical details, quotes, imagery sources
4. **Follow TIMELINE.md**: Chronological structure and key turning points
5. **Check CITATIONS.md**: Full source details for bibliography

### For Designers (G3-G4 Design/Spec)
1. **Visual treatment**: Metallurgical aesthetic (Damascus patterns, hamon lines, forge colors)
2. **Scroll-lock sequences**: Forging process, blade anatomy, combat techniques, pattern-welding
3. **Era treatments**: Bronze Age (ochre), Medieval (manuscript), Japanese (minimalist), Modern (archival)
4. **Image sources**: Museum collections identified in CITATIONS.md
5. **Color palette**: Derive from SYNTHESIS.md recommendations

### For Fact-Checkers (G6 Citation Audit)
1. **Every claim must trace**: Inline citation → CLAIMS.md → CITATIONS.md → source passage
2. **Legendary material marked**: King Arthur, Kusanagi, attributed quotes clearly noted
3. **Technical claims verified**: Metallurgy sources (Verhoeven, Yoshihara, Williams)
4. **Cultural claims verified**: Primary sources (Musashi, Kojiki, Fiore) or scholarly analysis
5. **No unsupported claims**: Check against "Claims NOT Supported" section in CLAIMS.md

## Research Gaps & Limitations

### Successfully Addressed
- ✅ Global coverage (Europe, Japan, Middle East, China)
- ✅ Technical accuracy (metallurgy from expert sources)
- ✅ Cultural context (primary texts and scholarly analysis)
- ✅ Visual documentation (major museum collections identified)
- ✅ Historical depth (Bronze Age through modern era)
- ✅ Cross-cultural balance (avoiding Eurocentrism)

### Remaining Gaps
- **African traditions**: Limited coverage beyond North Africa (Ethiopian shotel, West African takoba under-represented)
- **Southeast Asian swords**: Kris, kampilan, other regional traditions not deeply covered
- **Modern martial arts revival**: Contemporary practice (HEMA, iaido) represented indirectly
- **Economic aspects**: Production costs, trade economics, market forces less developed
- **Archaeological methods**: How we know what we know could be expanded

**Note**: These gaps are documented for transparency. The essay can be comprehensive without covering every regional tradition. Gaps indicate areas for potential future expansion, not deficiencies in current research.

### Legendary vs. Historical
**Clear Distinction Maintained**:
- **Verified history**: Archaeological evidence, documented figures, technical analysis
- **Cultural mythology**: Arthurian legends, Kusanagi mythology — presented as culturally significant stories
- **Attributed traditions**: Sayings passed through oral tradition — marked as attributed, not documented

All mythological material will be contextualized as culturally significant, not presented as historical fact.
