## Research Gaps & Limitations

### Successfully Addressed
- ✅ Global coverage (Europe, Japan, Middle East, China)
- ✅ Technical accuracy (metallurgy sources from experts)
- ✅ Cultural context (primary texts and scholarly analysis)
- ✅ Visual documentation (major museum collections identified)
- ✅ Historical depth (Bronze Age through modern era)

### Remaining Gaps
- **African sword traditions**: Limited coverage beyond North Africa. Sub-Saharan African blade traditions (Ethiopian shotel, West African takoba) under-represented in this source set.
- **Southeast Asian swords**: Kris, kampilan, and other regional traditions not deeply covered.
- **Modern martial arts revival**: Contemporary practice (HEMA, iaido, etc.) represented only indirectly.
- **Archaeological metallurgy**: More technical papers on ancient metallurgy could strengthen Bronze/Iron Age sections.

### Legendary vs. Historical
Sources clearly distinguish between:
- **Verified history**: Archaeological evidence, documented historical figures, technical analysis
- **Cultural mythology**: Arthurian legends, Japanese mythology (Kusanagi), legendary smiths
- **Attributed traditions**: Sayings and practices passed down through martial traditions

All mythological material is contextualized as culturally significant stories, not historical fact.
