## Research Methodology

### Source Selection Criteria Applied
1. ✅ Primary sources prioritized (museum collections, historical texts)
2. ✅ Scholarly secondary sources (peer-reviewed research, academic monographs)
3. ✅ Technical accuracy (metallurgical research from materials scientists)
4. ✅ Cultural authenticity (regional experts, primary texts)
5. ✅ Visual documentation (all claims supported by physical artifacts)

### Verification Process Completed
1. ✅ URL verification (all online sources accessed 2025-01-02)
2. ✅ Quote authentication (traced to sources or marked as attributed)
3. ✅ Cross-referencing (major claims have multiple sources)
4. ✅ Gap documentation (unsupported claims identified and excluded)

### Quality Standards Met
- ✅ No Tier 4 (unreliable) sources
- ✅ No fabricated sources
- ✅ No single-source claims for major assertions (triangulated)
- ✅ Legendary material clearly distinguished from history
- ✅ Regional/cultural accuracy verified

---

## Gaps and Limitations (Transparently Documented)

### Successfully Addressed
- ✅ Global scope (multiple traditions represented)
- ✅ Technical accuracy (expert metallurgical sources)
- ✅ Cultural context (primary texts and scholarly analysis)
- ✅ Visual documentation (museum collections identified)
- ✅ Historical depth (5,000+ years)

### Acknowledged Limitations
- ⚠️ African traditions (beyond North Africa) under-represented
- ⚠️ Southeast Asian traditions (kris, kampilan) limited coverage
- ⚠️ Modern martial arts revival represented indirectly
- ⚠️ Economic aspects less developed
- ⚠️ Women's relationship with swords under-documented

**Note**: These limitations are documented in GAPS.md for transparency. The essay can be comprehensive without covering every regional tradition.

### Unsupported Claims (Excluded from Essay)
- ❌ "Damascus steel secret lost forever" (oversimplification)
- ❌ "Katana can cut through armor" (not supported)
- ❌ "Medieval swords weighed 10-15 pounds" (contradicted by evidence)
- ❌ Specific kill counts for historical figures (unverifiable)

**All documented in GAPS.md to prevent inclusion in essay.**
