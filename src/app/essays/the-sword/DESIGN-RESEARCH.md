## Design Research Overview

**Subject**: The Sword -- For 5,000 Years, the Most Important Object a Human Could Own

A visual essay spanning 5,000 years of sword-making, sword-fighting, and sword-meaning across Japanese, European, and Islamic traditions. The subject demands a visual identity rooted in metallurgical aesthetics -- the actual colors, textures, and patterns that emerge from forging steel, tempering blades, and the patinas of age. This is not a military history essay dressed in red and black. It is an essay about craft, transformation, and the relationship between human skill and raw material. The design must feel forged.

**Key Design Challenges**:
1. Spanning 5,000 years without the visual identity fragmenting into disconnected era treatments
2. Representing three major cultural traditions (Japanese, European, Islamic) without stereotyping any of them
3. Making metallurgical content visually compelling rather than dry and technical
4. Balancing the violence inherent in the subject with the craftsmanship and cultural depth
5. Creating a unified palette that derives from actual blade materials rather than generic "weapon" aesthetics

## Visual Identity Analysis

### Subject Matter Characteristics

**Subject IS**:
- Metallurgical: born from fire, iron, carbon, and human skill
- Cross-cultural: Japanese, European, Islamic traditions converging
- Temporal: spanning deep time from Bronze Age to present
- Material: steel, iron, bronze, wood, leather, silk cord
- Philosophical: "the soul of the samurai," symbol of kingship, tool of justice
- Crafted: the product of master-apprentice lineages and embodied knowledge
- Dual-natured: weapon and art object, destroyer and cultural artifact

**Subject IS NOT**:
- Fantasy or genre fiction (no glowing runes, no dragon motifs)
- Purely military (this is about craft and meaning, not body counts)
- Monochrome or austere (blades are rich with color when you look closely)
- Exclusively masculine (the essay addresses sword culture, not warrior worship)
- Dark or gothic (steel catches light; forging is luminous)

### Visual Treatment Decision

**Primary Medium**: Photography (museum artifact photography) supplemented by technical illustration (blade anatomy, forging processes, metallurgical diagrams)

**Rationale**:
1. The world's great museum collections (Metropolitan Museum, British Museum, Tokyo National Museum, Wallace Collection, Royal Armouries) hold thousands of high-resolution photographs of actual blades -- these are the primary visual material
2. Technical processes (forging, differential hardening, pattern-welding) require illustrated cross-sections and diagrams that photography cannot capture
3. Mixed treatment allows the essay to move between reverence (photographic close-ups of hamon lines, Damascus patterns) and understanding (annotated diagrams of blade geometry, metallurgical structures)

## Visual Archaeology Findings

### Primary Materials and Associations

**Materials**:
- Tamahagane (Japanese smelted steel): rough, granular, blue-black before forging
- Damascus/wootz steel: swirling carbide patterns visible on polished surface, silver-to-charcoal gradients
- Pattern-welded iron/steel: layered rods creating flowing, organic patterns in cross-section
- Bronze: warm gold-to-green patina on archaeological specimens
- Hamon (temper line): milky-white crystalline boundary between hard edge and soft spine, visible on polished Japanese blades
- Hada (grain pattern): subtle wood-grain-like texture in the steel body of Japanese blades
- Forge fire: deep orange-to-white heat spectrum of steel being worked
- Oxide patina: blue-black, brown, and purple surface colors that develop on aged steel
- Wrapping materials: ray skin (white, granular texture), silk ito cord (deep indigo, crimson, black)

**Textures**:
- Hammered steel: the dimpled, uneven surface of a blade before final polishing
- Mirror-polished steel: the reflective surface of a finished blade
- Damascus watered-silk: the flowing, cloud-like pattern of carbide banding
- Hamon crystalline boundary: a frosted, granular line against polished steel
- Weathered bronze: rough, corroded, green-crusted surfaces on archaeological pieces
- Manuscript vellum: the warm, textured parchment of medieval fencing manuals

**Era Associations**:
- Bronze Age (3000-1200 BCE): archaeological warmth, golden-green patinas, earth tones
- Medieval (500-1500 CE): manuscript illumination, heraldic formality, candlelight
- Japanese Golden Age (1200-1400 CE): minimalist precision, the quiet drama of a polished blade
- Crusades (1095-1291 CE): collision of curved and straight, gold calligraphy and stone carvings
- Modern (1800-present): museum lighting, archival photography, scientific analysis

**Emotional Tone**: Reverence. Not for violence, but for the accumulated skill of generations -- the same reverence you feel standing before a Masamune blade in a quiet museum gallery. Weight, precision, and quiet authority.

### Historical Color Associations

The following colors are extracted directly from the physical materials of sword-making and sword artifacts:

1. **Tamahagane Blue-Black** (#2B2D42): The dark, blue-tinged steel of raw Japanese smelted steel before forging. This is the essay's anchor color -- the raw material from which everything is made.

2. **Hamon White** (#E8E4DE): The milky, crystalline white of the temper line on a polished Japanese blade. Martensite crystals create this frosted boundary. This is the essay's primary light tone.

3. **Forge Orange** (#D4622B): The deep, saturated orange of steel heated to forging temperature (approximately 800-900 degrees Celsius). Not a bright fire-engine orange but the dense, glowing color of metal at working heat.

4. **Damascus Silver** (#A8A9AD): The cool, medium gray of polished Damascus steel with its characteristic carbide patterns visible. Sits between the dark tamahagane and the light hamon.

5. **Oxide Purple-Brown** (#5C4742): The dark, warm brown with purple undertones that develops on aged steel through oxidation. Visible on museum specimens, particularly European medieval blades.

6. **Bronze Patina** (#6B7F4E): The muted green-gold of archaeological bronze, present on the oldest swords in the timeline. Used sparingly for Bronze Age sections.

7. **Silk Indigo** (#2C3E6B): The deep blue of traditional silk ito cord wrapping on Japanese sword hilts. A secondary accent that connects to Japanese craft tradition.

### Recurring Visual Motifs

1. **The Hamon Line**: The temper line on a Japanese blade is a natural visual motif -- a boundary between states of matter (hard martensite edge, soft pearlite spine). Used as a section divider or decorative element, it represents the essay's central tension: the marriage of opposites (hard/soft, beauty/function, weapon/art).

2. **Damascus Patterning**: The swirling, organic patterns of carbide banding in Damascus steel. These flowing, cloud-like forms can serve as background textures or decorative elements for sections about Islamic and Middle Eastern traditions.

3. **The Fuller (Blood Groove)**: The long channel running down a blade's flat is actually a weight-reduction feature, an I-beam principle. As a visual element, its long, narrow form can serve as a progress indicator or timeline track.

4. **The Cruciform**: The shape of the European medieval sword -- blade, crossguard, grip, pommel -- forms a cross. This shape is loaded with meaning (Christianity, balance, the four directions). It appears naturally in section headers or navigation elements.

5. **Forge Glow Gradient**: The color gradient of heated steel -- from cherry red through orange to white-hot -- serves as a visual metaphor for transformation. Used in scroll-lock sequences about forging processes.

6. **The Grain (Hada)**: The wood-grain-like texture visible in the body of a Japanese blade. Subtle background texture that adds depth without competing with content.

### Color Psychology Justification

- **Tamahagane Blue-Black** as primary: Steel is the essay's true subject. Not the violence done with it, but the material itself. Starting from the color of raw steel grounds every design decision in material reality.
- **Forge Orange** as secondary: The forge is where transformation happens -- raw material becomes blade, ore becomes steel. This color represents the central act of the essay: human skill applied to raw material. It is warm without being aggressive.
- **Hamon White** as accent/text: The temper line is where the blade's dual nature becomes visible -- the boundary between hard and soft. Using it for text creates a metaphor: information emerges from the dark background like the hamon emerges from the steel.
- **Dark backgrounds**: A traditional sword polisher works in a dim room so that light catches the blade's features. Museum display cases use dark backgrounds to highlight blade surfaces. The essay's dark palette serves the same function: making the subject luminous against darkness.

### Accessibility Notes

- Primary text (#E8E4DE) on background (#0F1017): Contrast ratio approximately 14.5:1 (exceeds WCAG AAA)
- Secondary text (#A8A9AD) on background (#0F1017): Contrast ratio approximately 8.2:1 (exceeds WCAG AAA)
- Muted text (#6B6E7A) on background (#0F1017): Contrast ratio approximately 4.6:1 (meets WCAG AA for large text; used only for supplementary labels)
- Forge orange (#D4622B) on background (#0F1017): Contrast ratio approximately 5.1:1 (meets WCAG AA)
- All interactive elements will use forge orange or hamon white, both exceeding minimum contrast requirements

## Typography Selection

### Typography Stack

**Display**: Cormorant Garamond (Bold/SemiBold) -- a refined, high-contrast serif with roots in 16th-century Garamond tradition. Selected because Claude Garamond was a contemporary of the Renaissance swordsmiths; his typefaces were cut in the same era that produced the finest rapiers and the codification of European fencing. The high stroke contrast echoes the precision of a blade edge. Cormorant is the open-source revival, available via Google Fonts.

**Serif/Body Heading**: Cormorant Garamond (Regular/Medium) -- continuity with display for section headings and pull quotes. The lighter weights carry the same refined character without competing with display usage.

**Body**: Source Serif 4 (Regular/Italic) -- a contemporary serif designed for extended reading on screens. Selected for its clarity and warmth. The slightly wedge-shaped serifs have a quality reminiscent of chisel-cut inscriptions -- the kind found on sword tangs and blade inscriptions (Ulfberht, Japanese mei signatures). Source Serif 4 is open-source (Adobe), designed for digital reading.

**Monospace/Technical**: JetBrains Mono -- used exclusively for metallurgical data, measurements, and technical annotations in diagrams. Clean, precise, utilitarian. The kind of typeface you would find in a materials science journal.

### Typography Justification

- **Cormorant Garamond** for display: The Garamond tradition (1530s France) is contemporary with the height of European sword culture -- the rapier era, the codification of fencing schools, the transition from medieval longsword to Renaissance dueling. This typeface carries the authority and refinement of that period without being overtly decorative. Its high contrast between thick and thin strokes mirrors the blade's own contrast between edge and flat.

- **Source Serif 4** for body: Japanese blade inscriptions (mei) are cut into the tang with a chisel, creating characters with wedge-shaped terminals. European blade inscriptions (Ulfberht, Solingen marks) were often inlaid into the steel. Source Serif 4's wedge serifs echo this incised quality while remaining fully optimized for screen reading. It is a modern typeface that carries the memory of inscription.

- **JetBrains Mono** for technical: When the essay presents metallurgical data (carbon content percentages, temperature ranges, Rockwell hardness values), it shifts into a precise, technical register. Monospace type signals this shift -- the reader enters the materials scientist's domain.

## Animation Philosophy

### Subject Nature Analysis

**Subject Is**:
- Forged: created through repeated heating, hammering, folding, quenching
- Patient: a Japanese blade takes weeks to months; a master smith's training takes decades
- Precise: a fraction of a degree in quench temperature changes the blade's character
- Weighty: swords have mass, momentum, and physical presence
- Dual-natured: hard edge and soft spine, beauty and lethality, weapon and art

**Animation Should**:
- Feel like forging: deliberate, weighty, transformative
- Support the essay's pacing: slow reveals for contemplative sections, sharper transitions for combat and collision
- Reveal structure: elements should appear as if being uncovered or polished, like a blade emerging from rough steel
- Carry weight: nothing should feel floaty or trivial; every motion should have the gravity of steel
- Honor the craft: animations should feel intentional, not decorative

### Animation Principles

**Overall Tempo**: Measured. Not slow for the sake of atmosphere, but deliberate -- the pacing of a swordsmith who knows that rushing ruins the blade. Base transition duration: 500-700ms for major reveals, 300ms for micro-interactions.

**Reveal Style**: Emergence. Elements appear as if being revealed from darkness, like a blade being drawn from a scabbard or a polished surface catching light for the first time. Primary reveal: opacity + subtle upward translation (8-12px). No bouncing, no overshooting.

**Easing**: `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0)` -- a custom ease-out that starts with moderate speed and decelerates smoothly. Inspired by the arc of a hammer strike: quick acceleration, controlled follow-through, definitive stop.

### Scroll-Lock Sequences

**Sequence 1: Forging a Japanese Blade**
- Purpose: Show the complete transformation from raw tamahagane to finished blade
- Feel: Meditative, rhythmic, like watching a smith work
- 0-15%: Raw tamahagane appears -- rough, granular, blue-black
- 15-30%: Heating (forge glow gradient washes over the steel)
- 30-50%: Folding and hammering (shape emerges, annotations appear for fold count, carbon distribution)
- 50-65%: Rough shaping (blade profile emerges from the billet)
- 65-80%: Clay application and quenching (hamon line appears along the edge)
- 80-90%: Polishing (surface detail emerges -- hada grain, hamon crystals)
- 90-100%: Finished blade -- full reveal with technical annotations

**Sequence 2: Blade Anatomy Reveal**
- Purpose: Progressive annotation of a sword's functional components
- Feel: Analytical, precise, like a museum exhibit label system
- 0-20%: Full blade silhouette appears
- 20-40%: Edge geometry highlighted (cross-section appears showing wedge profile)
- 40-55%: Fuller revealed with annotation (weight reduction, I-beam principle)
- 55-70%: Tang and hilt assembly (how blade connects to handle)
- 70-85%: Surface features (hamon, hada for Japanese; fuller, inscription for European)
- 85-100%: Complete annotated diagram with all labels visible

**Sequence 3: Cross-Cultural Collision (Crusades)**
- Purpose: Show European and Middle Eastern blade traditions side by side
- Feel: Tension, then recognition -- two traditions facing each other
- 0-25%: European longsword enters from left (straight, cruciform, heavy)
- 25-50%: Middle Eastern scimitar enters from right (curved, elegant, light)
- 50-75%: Comparison annotations appear (weight, balance point, edge geometry, steel type)
- 75-100%: Merge into shared influence -- elements of each tradition that crossed over

**Sequence 4: Pattern-Welding Process**
- Purpose: Show how composite blades are constructed from separate rods
- Feel: Building, layering, accumulating complexity
- 0-20%: Individual iron and steel rods appear (labeled with carbon content)
- 20-40%: Rods bundled and forge-welded together
- 40-60%: Twisted and folded (pattern begins to emerge)
- 60-80%: Forged into blade shape (pattern visible on surface)
- 80-100%: Polished and etched (full pattern revealed with microscopy detail)

**Sequence 5: 5,000-Year Timeline Sweep**
- Purpose: Compress the full chronological arc into a single scroll experience
- Feel: Deep time -- the weight of millennia passing
- 0-10%: Bronze Age -- warm golden tones, short stubby blades
- 10-25%: Iron Age -- darker palette, longer blades, regional divergence begins
- 25-50%: Medieval peak -- three traditions shown in parallel (European, Japanese, Islamic)
- 50-65%: Crusades collision -- traditions converge briefly
- 65-80%: Early modern -- rapier refinement, Edo period, ceremonial transition
- 80-90%: Gunpowder obsolescence -- blades recede, firearms advance
- 90-100%: Modern revival -- museum display, martial arts, scientific analysis

### Parallax

- **Intensity**: Subtle (0.05-0.15 parallax factor). Swords are heavy objects; excessive parallax would make them feel weightless. Background layers shift slowly, like the deep shadows in a forge. Foreground text and annotations remain fixed.
- **Rationale**: The subject's physical weight demands visual weight. Parallax should create depth (the forge is a deep, layered space) without undermining the solidity of the objects.

### Animation Timing

| Element | Duration | Easing | Rationale |
|---------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Section reveal | 600ms | cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0) | Deliberate, like drawing a blade from its scabbard |
| Image fade-in | 700ms | ease-out | Slow emergence, like a blade catching light |
| Text block reveal | 400ms | ease-out | Readable pace, not distracting |
| Annotation appear | 300ms | ease-out | Quick, precise -- like a label being placed |
| Pull quote reveal | 800ms | cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) | Slightly dramatic, befitting the weight of the words |
| Scroll-lock step | 500ms | ease-in-out | Smooth transitions between forging stages |
| Progress bar fill | continuous | linear | Steady, inevitable -- like the passage of time across 5,000 years |
| Hamon line draw | 1200ms | cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1) | Slow, organic reveal of the temper line -- the essay's signature animation |

### Reduced Motion

When `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active:
- All scroll-lock sequences show final state immediately
- Section reveals use opacity only (no translation)
- Parallax disabled entirely
- Hamon line draw shows complete line without animation
- Timeline sweep shows static layout
- All durations reduced to 0ms or show final frame

## Visual Style Guide

### Photography Approach

**Primary Sources**: Museum artifact photography from Metropolitan Museum (Open Access), British Museum (Creative Commons), Tokyo National Museum, Wallace Collection, Royal Armouries.

**Style Characteristics**:
- Dark, neutral backgrounds (museum display standard) -- aligns naturally with the essay's dark palette
- High-resolution detail shots: hamon lines, Damascus patterns, hilt construction, blade inscriptions
- Full-blade photographs for typological comparison
- Environmental shots of forge interiors, polishing workshops (for craft sections)
- Manuscript pages from Fiore dei Liberi's "Fior di Battaglia" for combat technique sections

**What to Avoid**:
- Dramatic, cinematic sword photography (Hollywood aesthetic)
- Reenactment photography with costumed actors
- Stock photography of generic swords
- Overly saturated or color-graded images

### Technical Illustration Approach

**Style Characteristics**:
- Clean line drawings on dark backgrounds (hamon white lines on tamahagane backgrounds)
- Cross-sectional views of blade construction (edge geometry, composite layering)
- Exploded views of hilt assemblies
- Metallurgical diagrams (crystal structure, carbon distribution)
- Annotations use the technical monospace font (JetBrains Mono) for measurements and the body serif (Source Serif 4) for descriptions

**What to Avoid**:
- Overly stylized or decorative illustrations
- Cartoon-like simplifications
- Illustrations that prioritize aesthetics over accuracy

### Visual Progression

The essay's visual treatment shifts subtly across its six acts to reflect the changing character of each era:

| Act | Era | Visual Shift |
|-----|-----|-------------|
| Act 1: Birth | Bronze Age (3000-1200 BCE) | Warmer tones (`--color-era-bronze`), archaeological textures, golden-green patina accents |
| Act 2: Evolution | Iron Age (1200 BCE-500 CE) | Darker, cooler tones returning to primary palette, rougher textures |
| Act 3: Golden Age | Medieval Peak (500-1500 CE) | Full primary palette, manuscript-style decorative borders for European sections, clean minimalism for Japanese sections |
| Act 4: Collision | Crusades (1095-1500 CE) | Split-screen compositions, dual color accents (`--color-era-medieval` and `--color-era-islamic`), tension in layout |
| Act 5: Transformation | Early Modern (1500-1868 CE) | Slightly lighter palette, more ornamental detail (rapier hilts), refined spacing |
| Act 6: Death and Resurrection | Modern (1868-Present) | Return to primary palette, museum-display aesthetic, scientific diagram style |

---

## Progress Bar Concept

**Concept**: "The Fuller"

**Visual Design**: A long, narrow channel running along the edge of the viewport (left side on desktop, top on mobile), inspired by the fuller -- the groove that runs down a sword blade. As the reader scrolls, the fuller fills with the forge-orange color (`--color-secondary`, #D4622B), like molten steel being poured into a mold.

The fuller has subtle depth -- a slight inset shadow on its edges that makes it feel carved into the page, just as a real fuller is forged into the blade. At key section boundaries (act transitions), small notch marks appear along the fuller, like the file marks a smith leaves on the tang to indicate provenance.

**Justification**: The fuller is one of the most misunderstood features of a sword (commonly called a "blood groove," it is actually an engineering innovation for weight reduction). Using it as the progress indicator teaches the reader something about sword design while serving a functional purpose -- mirroring the sword's own principle of form serving function.

**Specifications**:
- Width: 4px (desktop), 3px (mobile)
- Color (unfilled): `--color-border` (#3A3C4E)
- Color (filled): `--color-secondary` (#D4622B)
- Notch marks at act boundaries: 8px wide tick marks in `--color-text-muted`
- Position: Fixed left edge (desktop), fixed top edge (mobile)
- Depth effect: 1px inset shadow using `--color-background` on each side

## Layout Pattern Strategy

### Recommended Patterns (minimum 3, no consecutive same)

1. **Full-Bleed Hero** (`pattern-hero-full`)
   - For: Act openers, major section introductions
   - Rationale: A sword displayed in a museum case commands the full field of vision. Act openers should do the same -- a single striking image (blade detail, forge interior, manuscript page) filling the viewport with text overlaid.
   - Usage: Act 1 opener (bronze blade on dark background), Act 3 opener (Masamune blade detail), Act 4 opener (Crusader and Saracen blades facing each other)

2. **Split Comparison** (`pattern-split-compare`)
   - For: Cross-cultural comparisons, before/after states, technique contrasts
   - Rationale: The essay's central narrative device is collision -- traditions meeting, techniques compared, philosophies contrasted. A split layout (50/50 or 60/40) with a dividing line (styled as a blade edge) places two traditions side by side.
   - Usage: European longsword vs. Middle Eastern scimitar, Masamune vs. Muramasa philosophy, bronze vs. iron blade properties

3. **Annotated Artifact** (`pattern-artifact-annotated`)
   - For: Detailed examination of specific blades, blade anatomy, technical features
   - Rationale: Museum exhibit style -- a central high-resolution image with annotation lines extending to labeled callouts. This is how the Metropolitan Museum presents its finest pieces, and it is how the essay should present blade details.
   - Usage: Blade anatomy reveal, hamon line detail, Damascus pattern close-up, Ulfberht inscription

4. **Narrative Flow** (`pattern-narrative-flow`)
   - For: Extended prose sections, biographical passages, philosophical content
   - Rationale: When the essay tells stories (Musashi's duels, William Marshal's tournaments, Masamune's workshop), the layout should recede and let the prose carry the reader. Centered text column (max-width 680px), generous line height (1.7), pull quotes breaking the column.
   - Usage: Figure profiles, philosophical passages (Musashi quotes, Davidson analysis), narrative transitions between acts

5. **Scroll-Lock Technical** (`pattern-scroll-lock`)
   - For: Forging sequences, pattern-welding process, metallurgical diagrams
   - Rationale: Technical processes require the reader's sustained attention. Locking the scroll while the visualization progresses step-by-step mirrors the smith's own requirement for sustained focus on each stage of the forging process.
   - Usage: Forging sequence (Sequence 1), pattern-welding (Sequence 4), blade anatomy (Sequence 2)

6. **Timeline Strip** (`pattern-timeline-strip`)
   - For: Chronological progression, era transitions, the 5,000-year sweep
   - Rationale: The fuller motif extended -- a horizontal or vertical timeline track with blade silhouettes morphing through the centuries. Each era is a station along the fuller.
   - Usage: Act transitions, the full timeline sweep (Sequence 5), technology evolution summary

### Layout Sequence (No Consecutive Repeats)

Example act-level sequencing:
- Act 1: `pattern-hero-full` (bronze blade) -> `pattern-narrative-flow` (Bronze Age context) -> `pattern-scroll-lock` (early forging) -> `pattern-artifact-annotated` (bronze blade anatomy)
- Act 2: `pattern-timeline-strip` (iron transition) -> `pattern-narrative-flow` (regional divergence) -> `pattern-split-compare` (iron vs. bronze) -> `pattern-artifact-annotated` (pattern-welded blade)
- Act 3: `pattern-hero-full` (Masamune blade) -> `pattern-scroll-lock` (Japanese forging) -> `pattern-narrative-flow` (Musashi) -> `pattern-split-compare` (Masamune vs. Muramasa)
- Act 4: `pattern-hero-full` (Crusades collision) -> `pattern-split-compare` (longsword vs. scimitar) -> `pattern-narrative-flow` (Saladin) -> `pattern-scroll-lock` (Damascus steel)
- Act 5: `pattern-artifact-annotated` (rapier hilt) -> `pattern-narrative-flow` (dueling culture) -> `pattern-timeline-strip` (transition to obsolescence)
- Act 6: `pattern-hero-full` (museum display) -> `pattern-narrative-flow` (revival) -> `pattern-timeline-strip` (modern appreciation)

## Mobile-Native Considerations

### Mobile-First Design

- Dark palette works well on OLED screens (true black saves battery, deep blacks look premium)
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements
- Scroll-lock sequences must work with touch gestures (vertical swipe drives progress)
- Split-comparison layouts stack vertically on mobile (top/bottom instead of left/right)
- Annotated artifact callouts reflow to list format below the image on narrow screens

### Typography for Mobile

- Body text: 16px minimum (Source Serif 4 is legible at this size)
- Display headings: Scale down proportionally but never below 28px for H1
- Pull quotes: 20px on mobile, centered with generous vertical padding
- Technical annotations: 13px minimum, monospace remains readable at this size
- Line height: 1.7 for body text (generous for thumb-scrolling readability)

### Touch Interactions

- Scroll-lock sequences: vertical swipe to progress (no horizontal swipe -- conflicts with browser navigation)
- Image zoom: pinch-to-zoom on artifact detail images
- Annotation reveal: tap on callout points to show labels (hover not available on touch)
- Timeline navigation: swipe along timeline strip to scrub through eras

### Performance Budget (Mobile)

- Total page weight target: under 2MB initial load (lazy-load images below fold)
- Image format: WebP with JPEG fallback, responsive srcset for mobile breakpoints
- Font loading: `font-display: swap` for all typefaces; system font stack as fallback
- Scroll-lock animations: use CSS transforms and opacity only (GPU-accelerated, no layout thrashing)
- Intersection Observer for lazy loading: images load 200px before entering viewport

## Accessibility Requirements

### Reduced Motion

- All scroll-lock sequences: show final state immediately with static annotations
- Section reveals: opacity-only transitions (no translate)
- Parallax: completely disabled
- Progress bar: static fill based on scroll position (no animation)
- Hamon line: shown complete without draw animation
- Timeline: static layout, all eras visible simultaneously

### Screen Reader Support

- All blade images: descriptive alt text identifying the blade type, origin, approximate date, and key visible features (e.g., "Japanese katana attributed to Masamune, Kamakura period, showing prominent hamon temper line in notare pattern")
- Scroll-lock sequences: provide text-only fallback content that describes the process being visualized
- Technical diagrams: detailed alt text plus optional long description linked via `aria-describedby`
- Timeline: semantic HTML structure (ordered list of events) accessible without visual presentation
- Pull quotes: proper `<blockquote>` with `cite` attribute
- Navigation: skip links for scroll-lock sequences (allow keyboard users to bypass locked sections)

### Color Contrast

- All text/background combinations verified above (see Accessibility Notes under Color Palette)
- Forge orange on dark background: 5.1:1 (WCAG AA)
- Links and interactive elements: underline plus color change on focus (not color-only indication)
- Diagram annotations: minimum 4.5:1 contrast against their immediate background
- Era-specific accent colors: used for decoration only, never as sole information carrier

### Keyboard Navigation

- Tab through all interactive elements in logical order
- Scroll-lock sequences: arrow keys to step through stages
- Escape key: exit scroll-lock and return to normal scrolling
- Focus indicators: 2px solid forge-orange outline on all focusable elements

## Uniqueness Verification

### What Makes This Design Unique

- **Color palette derived from actual metallurgical materials**: Tamahagane blue-black, hamon white, forge orange, Damascus silver -- these colors come from the physical reality of sword-making, not from a generic "dark and dangerous" weapon palette
- **The Fuller as progress indicator**: No other essay would use a weight-reduction groove as its navigation metaphor
- **Hamon line as section divider**: The temper line motif is specific to Japanese blade-making and serves as a visual metaphor for the marriage of opposites
- **Typography rooted in the sword's own era**: Garamond tradition (1530s) contemporaneous with rapier culture; wedge serifs echoing blade inscriptions
- **Animation philosophy of forging**: Deliberate, weighty, transformative -- not the quick-cut action of a fight scene but the patient rhythm of a smith at work
- **Era-specific visual shifts**: Subtle palette modulations across six acts track the sword's 5,000-year journey without breaking visual coherence

### Comparison to Previous Essays

**NOT like a food/drink essay**: No warm, inviting tones or organic textures. Steel is cold, precise, and manufactured through extreme heat.

**NOT like a nature essay**: No greens, no growth metaphors, no flowing organic animations. The sword is forged, not grown.

**NOT like a music/arts essay**: No vibrant colors, no playful animations. The sword demands reverence, not celebration.

**NOT like a technology essay**: No clean whites, no minimalist tech aesthetics. The sword is ancient craft, not modern innovation.

**Unique Elements**:
- Only this essay would use metallurgical color extraction (tamahagane, hamon, Damascus)
- Only this essay would use the fuller as a progress bar
- Only this essay would animate with forging tempo
- Only this essay would shift era palettes across a 5,000-year span
- Only this essay would use Garamond tradition for its period-appropriateness to sword culture

**Conclusion**: Visual identity is unique and could only exist for an essay about swords and sword-making. Every design decision traces to documented research about the physical materials, cultural contexts, and historical periods of the subject.

**Tier 1: Research Foundation (CRITICAL)**
- [x] All colors derived from documented subject materials (tamahagane, hamon, forge fire, Damascus, oxide patina, bronze patina, silk ito)
- [x] Typography justified by era and character (Garamond tradition = rapier era; wedge serifs = blade inscriptions)
- [x] Animation philosophy matches subject nature (forging tempo: deliberate, weighty, transformative)
- [x] Visual motifs emerge from subject-specific elements (hamon line, fuller, Damascus pattern, cruciform, forge glow)
- [x] No generic or default design choices without justification

**Tier 2: Design Excellence (IMPORTANT)**
- [x] Color palette feels authentic to subject (metallurgical, not cinematic)
- [x] Typography hierarchy supports narrative structure (six acts, multiple registers)
- [x] Animation timing appropriate for subject character (measured, not flashy)
- [x] Visual identity is unique (verified against hypothetical alternatives)
- [x] Cultural sensitivity maintained (three traditions honored without stereotyping)

**Tier 3: Implementation Readiness (REFINEMENT)**
- [x] Design Research Report complete and documented
- [x] All design decisions traceable to subject research
- [x] Mobile-native considerations addressed
