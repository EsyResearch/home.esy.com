## Project Identification

### Working Title
**The Sword** — *For 5,000 Years, the Most Important Object a Human Could Own*

### Topic Overview
**Subject**: Every civilization forged its identity at the point of a blade. A comprehensive visual essay tracing 5,000 years of sword-making, sword-fighting, and sword-meaning across cultures.

**Primary Angles** (confirmed):
- **Comprehensive Survey** with cross-cultural comparative framing
- Historical evolution (Bronze Age → modern ceremonial)
- Metallurgical innovation and craftsmanship mastery
- Cultural symbolism — power, honor, justice, identity
- Cross-cultural collision (Crusades: Damascus steel meets Toledo steel, katana philosophy meets longsword pragmatism)

---

## Intake Questionnaire

### 1. Topic Refinement
**Selected**: **Comprehensive Survey** with strong emphasis on **Craftsmanship & Metallurgy** and **Cultural Symbolism**. This is a cross-cultural collision narrative — civilizations meeting at the blade.

### 2. Target Audience
**Selected**: **General Curious** — Broad audience, richly rewarded with depth.

### 3. Visual Treatment
**Selected**: **Mixed Treatment** — Photography for artifacts/museum pieces, technical illustrations for blade anatomy and metallurgy. Design research will derive from metallurgical aesthetics: Damascus patterns, temper lines (hamon), oxide patinas.

### 4. Geographic/Cultural Scope
**Selected**: **Global Survey with Comparative Focus** — Japanese, Islamic, European traditions. The Crusades serve as the narrative collision point.

### 5. Timeline
No hard deadline. Production quality over speed.

### 6. Special Requirements (from brief)
**Must-include figures**: Masamune (Japanese master smith), the Toledo swordsmiths, Ulfberht (Viking master), Saladin, Miyamoto Musashi.
**Must-include collision**: Cross-cultural sword traditions collide during the Crusades — Damascus steel meets Toledo steel, katana philosophy meets longsword pragmatism.
**Visualization types**: WhisperingObject (blade anatomy — tang, fuller, hamon reveal their function), TimefoldSlider (bronze → iron → pattern-welded → modern ceremonial).
**Design research source**: Metallurgical aesthetics — Damascus patterns, temper lines, oxide patinas.

## SKILL.md Research Requirements Analysis

Based on the Visual Essay Invocation Framework, this project will require:

### Layer 4 Requirements (Figure Profiles)
**Target**: 5-15 key figures

**Potential Figure Categories** (depending on scope):
- Master swordsmiths (Masamune, Muramasa, etc.)
- Military leaders who wielded famous swords
- Monarchs associated with ceremonial swords
- Martial arts masters who codified sword techniques
- Metallurgists who advanced blade technology
- Collectors/historians who preserved sword heritage

**Requirements per Figure**:
- [ ] Verified biographical information
- [ ] At least one quotable statement with source
- [ ] Available photography or portraiture
- [ ] Key contributions documented

### Layer 4 Requirements (Timeline/Events)
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Major technological innovations (bronze → iron → steel → pattern welding → modern alloys)
- [ ] Pivotal battles where swords played decisive role
- [ ] Cultural turning points (samurai code, chivalry, dueling culture)
- [ ] Decline of sword as primary weapon (gunpowder era)
- [ ] Modern revival (martial arts, collecting, ceremonial use)

### Layer 4 Requirements (Visual Assets)
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Museum collections identified (Metropolitan Museum, British Museum, Tokyo National Museum, etc.)
- [ ] Manuscript sources for historical context
- [ ] Archival photography of famous swords
- [ ] Technical diagrams (if illustrated treatment)
- [ ] Cultural artifacts showing swords in context

### Layer 4 Requirements (Key Quotes)
**Target**: Minimum 10 verified quotes

**Potential Quote Sources**:
- Historical texts on swordsmanship (Miyamoto Musashi, Fiore dei Liberi, etc.)
- Military treatises
- Cultural commentaries on sword symbolism
- Modern historians and metallurgists
- Martial arts masters
- Museum curators and collectors

### Layer 5 Requirements (Era Treatments)
**Potential Era Distinctions**:
- Bronze Age (3000-1200 BCE) — Sepia tones, archaeological aesthetic
- Iron Age (1200 BCE-500 CE) — Darker, rougher textures
- Medieval (500-1500 CE) — Manuscript illumination style
- Renaissance (1400-1600) — Rich colors, artistic flourish
- Early Modern (1600-1800) — Dueling culture, refined aesthetics
- Modern (1800-present) — Archival photography, museum documentation

---

## Research Depth Assessment

### Recommended Depth: **DEEP**
**Rationale**: 
- Complex subject spanning millennia and multiple cultures
- Rich visual material available in museum archives
- Requires technical accuracy (metallurgy, martial techniques)
- Multiple expert domains (history, materials science, cultural studies)
- High potential for scroll-lock sequences (forging process, combat techniques, ceremonial use)

**Expected Source Count**: 15-25 Tier 1-2 sources

### Research Domains Required
- [ ] **Military History** — Warfare, tactics, battles
- [ ] **Cultural History** — Symbolism, ceremony, social status
- [ ] **Materials Science** — Metallurgy, forging techniques
- [ ] **Art History** — Sword as artistic object, decoration
- [ ] **Regional Expertise** — Depending on geographic scope selected
- [ ] **Museum/Archive Research** — Artifact documentation

---

## Viability Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
- **Rich Visual Material**: Museums worldwide have extensive sword collections
- **Compelling Narrative Arc**: Clear evolution from tool → weapon → symbol → artifact
- **Human Stories**: Master craftsmen, legendary warriors, cultural traditions
- **Scroll-Lock Potential**: Forging sequences, combat demonstrations, ceremonial rituals
- **Universal Interest**: Swords capture imagination across cultures and ages
- **Metaphor-Rich**: Honor, power, craftsmanship, obsolescence, legacy

### ⚠️ Challenges
- **Scope Management**: Topic is vast—requires clear boundaries
- **Technical Accuracy**: Metallurgy and martial techniques must be precise
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Avoid romanticizing violence or appropriating traditions
- **Source Verification**: Many sword legends lack historical documentation
- **Image Rights**: Museum photography may require permissions

### 🔴 Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Without clear focus, essay could become unfocused survey
- **Mythology vs. History**: Need to distinguish verified facts from legend
- **Eurocentrism**: Risk of privileging European sword traditions over others
- **Violence Depiction**: Must handle combat/warfare imagery responsibly

## Notes

This intake document follows the Visual Essay Orchestrator workflow for Phase 1: Intake (5%). The essay cannot proceed to Phase 2 (Research) until all questionnaire items are answered and research targets are clearly defined per SKILL.md requirements.

The topic "the sword" has exceptional potential for immersive visual storytelling, with rich opportunities for scroll-lock sequences (forging, combat, ceremony), strong human anchors (craftsmen, warriors, collectors), and clear metaphorical resonance (power, honor, obsolescence, legacy).

However, the scope must be clearly bounded to avoid producing an unfocused survey. The user's answers to the intake questionnaire will determine whether this becomes a focused deep-dive or a comparative survey, and will shape all subsequent research and production decisions.
