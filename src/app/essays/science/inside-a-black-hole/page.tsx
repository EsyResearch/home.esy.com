            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Surprisingly, nothing noticeable. The event horizon is not a physical surface — it's a mathematical boundary. An infalling observer in freefall would not feel any impact or sensation when crossing. For a supermassive black hole, you wouldn't even notice tidal forces. However, once crossed, no signal you send can ever reach the outside universe."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "No. Inside a black hole, the singularity is not a point in space you travel toward — it is a moment in your future. The roles of space and time swap inside the event horizon, making the singularity a temporal destination as unavoidable as next Tuesday. This is one of the most counterintuitive predictions of general relativity."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The information paradox arises because Hawking radiation — the faint thermal glow emitted by black holes due to quantum effects — appears to carry no information about what fell in. If a black hole evaporates completely, the information about everything it consumed seems to be permanently destroyed. But quantum mechanics says information can never be truly destroyed. This contradiction has been debated since 1976 and remains unresolved."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes. LIGO detected gravitational waves from merging black holes in 2015, and the Event Horizon Telescope photographed the shadow of the supermassive black hole M87* in 2019 and Sagittarius A* in 2022. These are among the most well-confirmed objects in astrophysics."
