# DEFINITIONS: Inside a Black Hole

> Key terms defined for the target audience (curious adults, no physics background).
> Every definition should pass the "dinner party test" — explainable in 2-3 sentences.

## Spacetime Terms

**Spacetime**: Space and time treated as a single connected fabric. You're always moving through spacetime — even sitting still, you're moving forward through time. Gravity is this fabric being curved.

**Metric**: The mathematical rule that tells you the "distance" between two events in spacetime. Different metrics describe different spacetimes. The Schwarzschild metric describes the spacetime around a non-rotating black hole.

**Light cone**: The set of all possible paths light could travel from a given event. Your future must lie inside your forward light cone (nothing can outrun light). Inside a black hole, all forward light cones point toward the singularity.

**Geodesic**: The "straightest possible path" through curved spacetime. In flat space, geodesics are straight lines. Near a black hole, geodesics curve dramatically. Freefall follows a geodesic — you feel weightless even while spacetime around you is extremely curved.

## Black Hole Anatomy

**Event horizon**: The boundary around a black hole from which nothing can escape. Not a physical surface — more like a point of no return. Cross it and every possible future leads to the singularity.

**Singularity**: The point (or, more accurately, the moment) where spacetime curvature becomes infinite according to general relativity. This signals a breakdown of the theory, not a real physical infinity. What actually happens there requires a theory we haven't built yet.

**Schwarzschild radius**: The radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole. For the Sun (if compressed to a black hole): about 3 km. For Earth: about 9 mm.

**Photon sphere**: A region at 1.5× the Schwarzschild radius where light can orbit the black hole. Photons that graze this sphere create the bright ring seen in the EHT image.

**Ergosphere**: A region outside the event horizon of a rotating black hole where spacetime itself is dragged along with the rotation. You cannot stand still here — you must co-rotate. Energy can be extracted from this region (Penrose process).

**Accretion disk**: A disk of superheated gas spiraling into a black hole. Friction heats the gas to millions of degrees, making it glow brightly in X-rays. This is what the EHT photographed — the black hole itself is invisible.

## Physics Concepts

**General relativity (GR)**: Einstein's theory of gravity (1915). Gravity is not a force — it's the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Predicts black holes, gravitational waves, gravitational lensing, and the expansion of the universe.

**Quantum mechanics (QM)**: The physics of the very small — atoms, particles, photons. Governs everything at subatomic scales. Fundamentally probabilistic. Its core principle (unitarity) says information is never destroyed.

**Unitarity**: The principle that the total probability of all possible outcomes of any quantum process always equals 1. In practice: information is never truly lost, only scrambled. The information paradox arises because Hawking radiation seems to violate this.

**Quantum field theory (QFT)**: The framework that combines quantum mechanics with special relativity. Describes particles as excitations of underlying fields. Hawking used QFT on curved spacetime to predict black hole radiation.

**Hawking radiation**: Faint thermal radiation emitted by black holes due to quantum effects near the event horizon. Causes black holes to slowly lose mass and eventually evaporate. The radiation appears random (thermal), which is the root of the information paradox.

**Tidal force**: The difference in gravitational pull between two nearby points. Responsible for ocean tides on Earth (Moon pulls harder on the near side than the far side). Near a black hole, tidal forces can be strong enough to tear apart atoms.

**Spaghettification**: The colloquial term for being stretched vertically and compressed horizontally by extreme tidal forces near a black hole. Named by Stephen Hawking.

## Diagrams and Tools

**Penrose diagram (conformal diagram)**: A way to draw the entire causal structure of spacetime on a finite 2D page. Key rule: light always travels at 45° angles. If you can read a Penrose diagram, you can see at a glance why nothing escapes a black hole.

**Gravitational lensing**: The bending of light by gravity. A black hole bends background light around itself, creating distorted images, Einstein rings, and extreme magnification. Predicted by Einstein (1936), directly observed many times.

**Einstein ring**: A perfect circle of light formed when a background light source, a massive lensing object, and the observer are exactly aligned. The black hole bends the light symmetrically around itself.

## Paradoxes and Open Questions

**Information paradox**: The contradiction between Hawking radiation (which appears to destroy information) and quantum mechanics (which says information is never destroyed). Unresolved since 1976.

**Firewall paradox (AMPS)**: The argument that three individually reasonable assumptions about black holes are mutually contradictory. Resolution may require abandoning the idea that the event horizon is a smooth, uneventful boundary.

**Black hole complementarity**: Susskind's proposed resolution — information is both inside the black hole AND reflected at the horizon. No single observer can witness the contradiction, so there is no paradox.

**Holographic principle**: The idea that all information in a 3D region of space can be fully described by data on its 2D boundary. Black holes realize this: their entropy (information content) is proportional to surface area, not volume.

**No-hair theorem**: A black hole in equilibrium is completely described by just three numbers: mass, charge, and spin. All other information about what formed it is inaccessible from outside.
