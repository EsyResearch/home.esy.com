# G1 Intake: Inside a Black Hole

**Topic**: What physics actually tells us about the interior of black holes — the real science, not the sci-fi
**Audience**: Curious adults who watch Kurzgesagt/Veritasium but haven't studied physics
**Must Include**: Penrose diagrams (simplified for non-physicists), gravitational lensing visualization, the information paradox, what happens at the singularity
**Quality Exemplar**: Kurzgesagt's "Black Holes" video as a scrollytelling reading experience
**What It's NOT**: Not a physics textbook, not sci-fi speculation, not about how black holes form (formation is context, not the story)
**Depth**: Deep
