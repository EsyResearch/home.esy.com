## Narrative Arc

**From Concrete to Abstract**: The essay moves through four "worlds" of waves, each more abstract than the last.

```
CONCRETE ──────────────────────────────────────────────── ABSTRACT

 Ocean Waves    Sound Waves    Light Waves    Quantum Waves
 (visible,      (invisible,    (no medium,    (probability,
  tangible)      pressure)      EM field)      not physical)

 Sec 1-2         Sec 3          Sec 4          Sec 8
```

The connecting tissue is Sections 5-7 (Superposition, Interference, Standing Waves), which apply across ALL wave types and build the bridge to quantum.

## Section-by-Section Learning Design

### Section 1: What Is a Wave?
- **Opens with**: The beach — everyone's watched waves. The hook: "Watch the seagull floating on the water. A wave passes under it. Where does the seagull end up? Right where it started."
- **Core insight**: A wave is energy on the move. The medium stays behind.
- **Closes with**: Circular particle orbit reveal — the anatomy beneath the surface.
- **Visualization**: D1 — Animated ocean wave cross-section showing circular particle paths.

### Section 2: The Language of Waves
- **Opens with**: "Every wave in the universe — from ocean to quantum — can be described with just four numbers."
- **Teaches**: Wavelength, frequency, amplitude, phase.
- **Anchoring**: Label each parameter directly on the ocean wave from Section 1.
- **Key equation**: v = fλ (presented visually, not symbolically — "speed = how often × how far apart")
- **Visualization**: Annotated overlay on D1 — interactive labels.

### Section 3: Waves You Can't See
- **Opens with**: "Clap your hands. You just made a wave."
- **Transition**: From transverse (ocean) to longitudinal (sound).
- **Teaches**: Compression/rarefaction, pitch = frequency, volume = amplitude.
- **Real-world anchor**: The Doppler effect (ambulance siren).
- **Misconception correction**: MC2 — "In space, no one can hear you scream" is physics, not tagline.
- **Visualization**: D2 — Sound pressure animation (particles bunching and spreading).

### Section 4: Waves You Can See
- **Opens with**: "Light is a wave with no medium. That sentence took physics 200 years to accept."
- **Teaches**: EM waves, visible spectrum, wavelength = color.
- **Misconception correction**: MC4 — All light travels at the same speed in vacuum.
- **Key detail**: The spectrum as a tiny window in a vast EM range.
- **Visualization**: D3 — Spectrum strip with wavelength scale.

### Section 5: When Waves Meet
- **Opens with**: "Throw two rocks into a still pond. Watch the ripples collide."
- **Teaches**: Superposition principle, constructive and destructive interference.
- **Real-world anchor**: Noise-canceling headphones (destructive interference).
- **Misconception correction**: MC5 — Energy is redistributed, not destroyed.
- **Visualization**: D4 — Interactive superposition combiner (two waves in, combined wave out).

### Section 6: The Ripple Tank
- **Opens with**: Short section — set up the double-source interference pattern.
- **Teaches**: How two coherent sources create stable interference patterns.
- **Visual focus**: The ripple tank simulation IS the section.
- **Bridge forward**: "Remember this pattern. You'll see it again in Section 8."
- **Visualization**: D5 — Interactive ripple tank (two sources, interference pattern).

### Section 7: Waves That Stand Still
- **Opens with**: "Pluck a guitar string. You're looking at a standing wave."
- **Teaches**: Nodes, antinodes, fundamental + harmonics, resonance.
- **THE BRIDGE**: "A guitar string can only vibrate at certain frequencies — the ones that fit. An electron can only exist at certain energy levels — for exactly the same reason."
- **Visualization**: D6 — Standing wave builder (harmonics on a string → Chladni patterns).

### Section 8: The Strangest Wave
- **Opens with**: "Send one electron at a time through two slits. After thousands of electrons, an interference pattern appears. But each electron went through one at a time. What was interfering?"
- **Teaches**: Quantum wave functions, probability amplitude, the Born rule (conceptually).
- **Misconception corrections**: MC6 (electrons don't orbit), MC7 (observation isn't consciousness).
- **THE CLIMAX**: The double-slit experiment as the essay's reveal moment.
- **Visualization**: D7 — Double-slit pattern building particle by particle.

### Section 9: Everything Is Waves
- **Opens with**: Synthesis — the universal pattern that spans ocean to quantum.
- **Teaches**: The wave equation as a universal structure; quantum field theory (one sentence).
- **Closing thought**: "Every particle is an excitation in a quantum field. Everything, at its most fundamental level, is waves."
- **No new visualization** — conceptual recap with pull quotes.

## Pacing & Cognitive Load

| Section | Length (words) | Cognitive Load | Interactive? | New Concepts |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | 300-400 | Low | Animated | 2 (wave, energy transfer) |
| 2 | 350-450 | Medium | Labeled | 4 (wavelength, frequency, amplitude, phase) |
| 3 | 400-500 | Medium | Animated | 3 (longitudinal, compression, Doppler) |
| 4 | 300-400 | Medium | Static-ish | 2 (EM wave, spectrum) |
| 5 | 350-450 | Medium-High | Interactive | 3 (superposition, constructive, destructive) |
| 6 | 200-300 | Medium | Interactive | 1 (interference pattern) |
| 7 | 400-500 | High | Interactive | 4 (standing wave, node, harmonic, resonance) |
| 8 | 400-500 | High | Scroll-triggered | 3 (wave function, probability, duality) |
| 9 | 200-300 | Low (synthesis) | None | 0 (recap) |

**Total estimated**: 3,000-3,800 words

### Cognitive Load Management

- Sections 1-2: **Entry ramp** — familiar, concrete, low load
- Sections 3-4: **Expansion** — new types of waves, but same parameters apply
- Sections 5-6: **New mechanics** — superposition is a genuinely new idea. Give it breathing room.
- Section 7: **The crux** — standing waves are the conceptual peak of classical wave physics
- Section 8: **The payoff** — quantum is the climax, but the standing wave bridge makes it feel earned, not imposed
- Section 9: **Cool-down** — synthesis, no new concepts, satisfying closure
