## Critical Misconceptions to Address

### MC1: "The water moves with the wave"
- **Wrong belief**: When an ocean wave passes, the water itself travels forward
- **Reality**: Water particles move in circular orbits (at the surface) and return to near their original position. The wave transports energy, not water. A cork bobs up and down — it doesn't surf to shore.
- **Where to address**: Section 1 (opener — this IS the hook)
- **Source**: C1.1, C1.2, C1.4
- **Severity**: Critical — this is the most common wave misconception

### MC2: "Sound travels through empty space"
- **Wrong belief**: Sound can travel through a vacuum, like in movies (explosions in space)
- **Reality**: Sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium (air, water, solid). In the vacuum of space, there is no medium — no sound. Every space battle movie gets this wrong.
- **Where to address**: Section 3
- **Source**: C3.1 (Kinsler, *Fundamentals of Acoustics*)
- **Severity**: High — reinforced by movies

### MC3: "Louder means higher pitch"
- **Wrong belief**: Volume and pitch are the same thing
- **Reality**: Volume (loudness) corresponds to amplitude. Pitch corresponds to frequency. You can have a loud low note and a quiet high note.
- **Where to address**: Section 3
- **Source**: C2.4 (amplitude), C3.3 (frequency ↔ pitch)
- **Severity**: Medium — common conflation

### MC4: "Red light is 'slower' than blue light"
- **Wrong belief**: Different colors of light travel at different speeds in vacuum
- **Reality**: ALL electromagnetic waves travel at exactly the same speed in vacuum: c = 299,792,458 m/s. Different colors have different wavelengths/frequencies, but the same speed. (They DO travel at different speeds in glass/water — that's dispersion, which is why prisms work.)
- **Where to address**: Section 4
- **Source**: C4.3, C4.4
- **Severity**: Medium — the prism demonstration actually creates this misconception if not explained

### MC5: "Destructive interference destroys energy"
- **Wrong belief**: When two waves cancel out, the energy disappears
- **Reality**: Energy is conserved. Where destructive interference reduces amplitude, constructive interference increases it elsewhere. The energy is redistributed, not destroyed.
- **Where to address**: Section 5
- **Source**: C5.1, C5.2 (Hecht, *Optics*)
- **Severity**: High — violates conservation of energy if left unaddressed

### MC6: "Electrons orbit the nucleus like planets orbit the sun"
- **Wrong belief**: Electrons are tiny balls following definite circular/elliptical paths
- **Reality**: Electrons are described by wave functions — standing wave patterns around the nucleus. The "orbit" is a probability cloud, not a trajectory. Atomic orbitals are 3D standing waves.
- **Where to address**: Section 8
- **Source**: C8.3, C8.4
- **Severity**: Critical — the Bohr model is deeply embedded in popular culture

### MC7: "Observing collapses the wave function because humans are special"
- **Wrong belief**: Consciousness or human observation causes quantum collapse
- **Reality**: "Observation" in physics means any interaction that extracts information — a photon hitting a detector, not a human watching. The measurement apparatus interacts with the system, not the observer's mind.
- **Where to address**: Section 8 (brief note, not deep dive)
- **Source**: C8.1 (Tonomura), C8.3 (Griffiths)
- **Severity**: High — feeds mysticism that the essay should counter

## Misconceptions to NOTE but Not Deeply Address

| Misconception | Why Note It | Handling |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| "Electromagnetic waves need a medium (ether)" | Historical — resolved by Einstein's SR | One sentence max |
| "Quantum means random" | Probability ≠ randomness | Brief mention if space allows |
| "Resonance only happens in bridges" | Tacoma Narrows is famous but narrow | Use guitar string instead |

## Pedagogical Strategy for Misconception Correction

Per pedagogy best practice (Posner et al., 1982 — "Accommodation of a Scientific Conception"):

1. **Activate** the misconception — state what people commonly believe
2. **Create dissatisfaction** — show why it doesn't work (the cork doesn't surf)
3. **Present** the correct model — with visual support
4. **Demonstrate superiority** — the correct model explains MORE than the misconception

This is more effective than simply stating the correct answer. The essay should actively trigger each misconception before correcting it.
