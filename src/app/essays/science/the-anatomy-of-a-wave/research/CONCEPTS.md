## Concept Map

The essay builds from concrete to abstract. Each concept builds on the one before it.

```
Physical Waves (ocean)
  ├── Energy transfer without matter transfer (foundational insight)
  ├── The four parameters: wavelength, frequency, amplitude, phase
  │
  ├── Transverse waves (up-down displacement perpendicular to travel)
  └── Longitudinal waves (compression-rarefaction along direction of travel)
        │
        ├── Sound (invisible longitudinal wave in air)
        └── Light (transverse electromagnetic wave — no medium needed)
              │
              ├── Superposition (waves can overlap and combine)
              │     ├── Constructive interference (amplify)
              │     └── Destructive interference (cancel)
              │
              ├── Interference patterns (ripple tank, double slit)
              │
              └── Standing waves (two opposing waves create fixed nodes)
                    ├── Harmonics on strings (music)
                    ├── Chladni patterns on surfaces (2D)
                    └── Atomic orbitals (3D standing wave patterns)
                          │
                          └── Quantum wave functions
                                ├── Probability amplitude, not physical displacement
                                └── Wave-particle duality (the deep mystery)

## Key Conceptual Bridges

### Bridge 1: Transverse → Longitudinal
- **From**: Ocean waves (visible up-and-down motion)
- **To**: Sound waves (invisible compression-rarefaction)
- **Bridge**: Both transfer energy without matter; they differ in the direction of oscillation relative to propagation
- **Visual strategy**: Show both side-by-side with the same wavelength/frequency labels

### Bridge 2: Mechanical → Electromagnetic
- **From**: Sound waves (need a medium — air, water, solid)
- **To**: Light waves (no medium needed — Maxwell's great insight)
- **Bridge**: Both obey v = fλ. Light's medium is the electromagnetic field itself.
- **Visual strategy**: The spectrum strip — wavelength determines color, just as frequency determines pitch

### Bridge 3: Single Wave → Superposition
- **From**: One wave, described by four parameters
- **To**: Multiple waves coexisting in the same space
- **Bridge**: The principle that waves ADD. This is not obvious — two balls can't occupy the same space, but two waves can.
- **Visual strategy**: Interactive combiner — two waves in, one combined wave out

### Bridge 4: Superposition → Standing Waves
- **From**: Two waves traveling in the same direction combine
- **To**: Two waves traveling in OPPOSITE directions create fixed nodes
- **Bridge**: Standing waves are a special case of superposition. They explain why strings vibrate at specific frequencies.
- **Visual strategy**: Slow-motion animation showing two counter-propagating waves creating a standing pattern

### Bridge 5: Standing Waves → Quantum
- **From**: Guitar strings vibrate at only certain frequencies (harmonics)
- **To**: Electrons exist at only certain energy levels (quantization)
- **Bridge**: Both are the same mathematical constraint: a standing wave must fit an integer number of half-wavelengths. This is THE conceptual link the essay builds toward.
- **Visual strategy**: Side-by-side — harmonic on a string → orbital around a nucleus
