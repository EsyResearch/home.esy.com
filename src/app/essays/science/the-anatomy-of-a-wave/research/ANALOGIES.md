## Core Analogies (Use in Essay)

### A1: The Stadium Wave (Section 1)
**Concept**: A wave transfers energy, not matter
**Analogy**: In a stadium wave, people stand up and sit down — they don't move sideways. But the wave travels around the entire stadium. The "wave" is the pattern, not the people.
**Why it works**: Everyone has seen a stadium wave. It makes the energy/matter distinction visceral.
**Source connection**: Direct parallel to C1.1 (energy transfer without matter transfer)

### A2: The Rope Flick (Section 1-2)
**Concept**: Transverse waves, wavelength, amplitude
**Analogy**: Hold one end of a rope and flick it. The bump travels down the rope, but each section of rope only moves up and down. The size of your flick is the amplitude. The distance from one bump to the next is the wavelength.
**Why it works**: Tactile, everyone can imagine it, directly maps to parameters.

### A3: The Slinky Push (Section 3)
**Concept**: Longitudinal waves, compression/rarefaction
**Analogy**: Push one end of a Slinky. A bunch-up (compression) travels down the coil. Each ring moves back and forth — not sideways. That's exactly what air molecules do when you clap your hands.
**Why it works**: Makes sound waves tangible. The Slinky is the canonical physics demo.

### A4: The Ambulance Siren (Section 3)
**Concept**: Doppler effect
**Analogy**: An ambulance approaching you sounds higher-pitched; moving away sounds lower. The waves ahead of the ambulance are bunched up (shorter wavelength = higher frequency); behind it they're stretched out.
**Why it works**: Universal human experience. Audio → visual connection is strong.

### A5: Throwing Two Rocks in a Pond (Section 5-6)
**Concept**: Superposition and interference
**Analogy**: Throw two rocks into a still pond. Where the ripples from both rocks meet, they interact: where two crests meet, the water goes extra high (constructive); where a crest meets a trough, the water goes flat (destructive).
**Why it works**: Visual, intuitive, maps directly to the ripple tank.

### A6: Guitar String = Quantum Atom (Section 7-8)
**Concept**: Standing waves → quantization
**Analogy**: A guitar string can only vibrate at specific frequencies — the fundamental and its harmonics. It can't vibrate at just any frequency because the ends are fixed. An electron around a nucleus has the same constraint: its wave function must "fit" around the nucleus, so only certain energy levels are allowed.
**Why it works**: This is THE bridge from classical to quantum. It's not a metaphor — it's the actual mathematical relationship.

## Supporting Metaphors (Use Sparingly)

### M1: The Mexican Wave vs. The Conveyor Belt
**Concept**: Wave vs. bulk transport
**The distinction**: A Mexican wave moves people's arms, not their bodies (energy transport). A conveyor belt moves the objects themselves (matter transport). Waves are like Mexican waves, not conveyor belts.

### M2: Piano Keys as Frequency
**Concept**: Frequency determines what we perceive (pitch, color)
**Metaphor**: Low keys on a piano = low frequency = deep bass. High keys = high frequency = bright treble. The electromagnetic spectrum is like an enormous piano keyboard where the "keys" go from radio waves (very low) all the way to gamma rays (extremely high), with visible light as one tiny octave in the middle.

### M3: Hotel Room Numbers
**Concept**: Quantization
**Metaphor**: You can stay on floor 1, 2, or 3 — but not floor 2.7. Quantum energy levels are like hotel floors. You can be at one level or another, never in between. Standing waves explain WHY: only certain wave patterns fit.

## Analogies to AVOID

| Bad Analogy | Why It Fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Sound is like ripples on a pond" | Sound is longitudinal, pond ripples are (primarily) transverse — this creates a misconception |
| "Electrons orbit like planets" | This is the Bohr model misconception — electrons are standing wave patterns, not orbiting particles |
| "Quantum waves are like ocean waves but tiny" | Quantum wave functions are probability amplitudes, not physical displacements — fundamentally different |
| "Light is a particle AND a wave at the same time" | Misleading — it's neither in the classical sense. Better: "It behaves wave-like in some experiments and particle-like in others" |
