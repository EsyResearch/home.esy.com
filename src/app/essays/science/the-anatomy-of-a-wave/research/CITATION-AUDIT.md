## Key Factual Claims Verified

1. **"A wave is a disturbance that transfers energy without transferring matter"** → Standard physics definition (Sources 1, 2, 4)
2. **"v = λf"** → Fundamental wave equation (Sources 1, 2, 4, 11, 13)
3. **"Concert pitch A is 440 Hz"** → ISO 16:1975 standard, widely cited
4. **"Light travels at 299,792,458 m/s"** → Exact speed of light, defined since 1983 (Source 8, 12)
5. **"Thomas Young demonstrated [double-slit] in 1801"** → Primary source (Source 5, dated 1802 publication)
6. **"Louis de Broglie proposed in 1924"** → Primary source (Source 6)
7. **"λ = h/p"** → De Broglie relation (Sources 3, 6, 10)
8. **"|ψ|² gives the probability density"** → Born rule (Sources 3, 10)
9. **"Max Planck proposed quantization of energy in 1900"** → Primary source (Source 9, published 1901)
10. **"Maxwell showed oscillating E and M fields sustain each other"** → Primary source (Source 8)

## Feynman Quote Attribution

> "I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."
— Richard Feynman, 1964

**Verification**: From Feynman's "The Character of Physical Law" lecture series at Cornell, 1964. Widely attributed and documented. ✓

## Misconception Callouts

All 4 misconception callouts cite correct physics:
1. "Waves carry matter" → Correctly debunked (Sources 1, 2)
2. "All waves need a medium" → Correctly distinguishes mechanical/EM (Sources 8, 12)
3. "A standing wave isn't moving" → Correctly explains two-wave mechanism (Sources 11, 13)
4. "Quantum wave function is physical" → Correctly describes probabilistic interpretation (Sources 3, 10)
