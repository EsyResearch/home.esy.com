## 1. Thematic Authenticity Check

### Is the design derived from the subject matter?

| Design Element | Subject Connection | Authentic? |
|---|---|---|
| Ocean Deep (#0a1929) | Deep ocean floor — literal origin of waves | ✅ Yes |
| Ocean Blue (#1a6fa0) | Mid-ocean water color | ✅ Yes |
| Sound Amber (#d4872c) | Warmth of pressure, vibration energy | ✅ Yes |
| Spectrum Violet (#7b2ff7) | Short-wavelength visible light | ✅ Yes — physically accurate |
| Quantum Violet (#6b3fa0) | Mystery, uncertainty — quantum's cultural color | ✅ Yes |
| Interference Cyan (#00bcd4) | Bright precision of wave interference | ✅ Yes |
| Constructive Green (#2ecc71) | Addition, growth | ✅ Semantic |
| Destructive Rose (#e74c3c) | Cancellation, warning | ✅ Semantic |
| Sinusoidal easing | The wave function itself as animation curve | ✅ Yes — deeply subject-derived |
| Progressive background shifts | Content moves from concrete to abstract | ✅ Yes — mirrors learning arc |

**Verdict**: ✅ The design is unmistakably wave-derived. No generic templates or borrowed aesthetics.

## 2. Cross-Essay Collision Check

### Comparison with all published Esy visual essays:

| Essay | Primary Palette | Collision Risk | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inside a Black Hole | Gold (#c4922a), Teal (#1a9e8f), Danger Red (#b5382a) | **Low** — No overlap. Wave essay uses ocean blue/quantum violet, not gold/teal. | None needed |
| The Geography of Water Scarcity | Earth tones, drought amber | **Low** — Wave's amber (#d4872c) is similar but serves a different meaning (sound, not drought) and appears in only one section. | Acceptable — different context |
| Etymology essays (various) | Manuscript tones, heritage palettes | **None** — Completely different visual language | N/A |

**Verdict**: ✅ No aesthetic collisions detected. The progressive-palette approach (different background per section) is unique to this essay.

## 3. CSS Implementability

### Can the design research be implemented with CSS custom properties?

| Token | CSS Variable | Implementable? |
|---|---|---|
| All 12 palette colors | `--wave-*` variables | ✅ Yes |
| Background gradients | `--wave-bg-*` | ✅ Yes (CSS linear-gradient) |
| Typography scale | `--wave-font-*` with clamp() | ✅ Yes |
| Easing functions | `--wave-ease-*` cubic-bezier | ✅ Yes |
| Spectrum gradient | Real CSS gradient | ✅ Yes |

### Potential Challenges

| Challenge | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| 7 progressive background sections | Medium — requires careful transition management | Use CSS class per section, IntersectionObserver for transitions |
| Interactive Canvas visualizations (D4, D5, D7) | Low — Canvas doesn't use CSS variables directly | Pass CSS variable values to Canvas via JavaScript |
| Reduced motion for continuous animations | Low — well-established pattern | `prefers-reduced-motion` media query wrapping all keyframes |

**Verdict**: ✅ Fully implementable. No exotic CSS required.

## 4. Spec ↔ Design Alignment

| Spec Requirement | Design Research Coverage | Aligned? |
|---|---|---|
| 9 sections with progressive abstraction | Background system matches — 7 distinct gradient themes | ✅ |
| 7 visualizations with tiers 1-3 | Each visualization has a dedicated style guide section | ✅ |
| Interactive controls (sliders, drag) | Interaction design section with touch targets ≥ 44px | ✅ |
| Mobile-first responsive | Three breakpoint system (mobile/tablet/desktop) | ✅ |
| Misconception callouts | Component pattern defined (red-bordered card) | ✅ |
| Definition tooltips | Inline definition component described | ✅ |
| ArtifactDetailWrapper | Spec Layer 6 specifies it, design doesn't contradict | ✅ |

**Verdict**: ✅ Design and spec are fully aligned.

## 5. Reconciliation Summary

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Thematic authenticity | ✅ PASS — Subject-derived palette, typography, and motion |
| Cross-essay novelty | ✅ PASS — No collisions with existing essays |
| CSS implementability | ✅ PASS — All tokens implementable as custom properties |
| Spec alignment | ✅ PASS — Design covers all spec requirements |
| [UNRECONCILED] markers | ✅ PASS — None present |
| [COLLISION] markers | ✅ PASS — None present |

### Overall Result: ✅ RECONCILED — No issues found

The design research for "The Anatomy of a Wave" is authentic, original, implementable, and aligned with the spec. Proceed to G4.5 (Image Sourcing).
