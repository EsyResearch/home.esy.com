## Must-Define Terms

These terms MUST be defined before use in the essay. Each definition should be plain language, no jargon.

### Foundational (Section 1-2)

| Term | Plain-Language Definition | First Used |
|------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Wave** | A disturbance that carries energy from one place to another, without carrying matter along with it. | Section 1 |
| **Medium** | The material a wave travels through — water, air, a guitar string. Not all waves need one. | Section 1 |
| **Wavelength (λ)** | The distance from one crest to the next — the "length" of one complete wave cycle. | Section 2 |
| **Frequency (f)** | How many complete wave cycles pass a point each second. Measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second. | Section 2 |
| **Amplitude** | The height of a wave measured from the resting position — the bigger the amplitude, the more energy the wave carries. | Section 2 |
| **Phase** | Where a wave is in its cycle at a given moment. Two waves "in phase" have their crests aligned; "out of phase" means crests don't align. | Section 2 |
| **Transverse wave** | A wave where the displacement is perpendicular to the direction of travel (like flicking a rope). | Section 1 |
| **Longitudinal wave** | A wave where the displacement is parallel to the direction of travel (like a slinky pushed end-to-end). | Section 3 |

### Sound & Light (Sections 3-4)

| Term | Plain-Language Definition | First Used |
|------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Compression** | A region where air particles are pushed closer together — the "crest" of a sound wave. | Section 3 |
| **Rarefaction** | A region where air particles are spread apart — the "trough" of a sound wave. | Section 3 |
| **Pitch** | How high or low a sound seems. Higher frequency = higher pitch. | Section 3 |
| **Doppler effect** | The change in frequency you hear when a sound source moves toward or away from you — the ambulance siren effect. | Section 3 |
| **Electromagnetic wave** | A wave made of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. Light, radio, X-rays, and microwaves are all electromagnetic waves at different frequencies. | Section 4 |
| **Dispersion** | When different wavelengths travel at different speeds through a material, separating white light into its colors. | Section 4 |

### Superposition & Interference (Sections 5-6)

| Term | Plain-Language Definition | First Used |
|------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Superposition** | When two waves overlap, the resulting wave is simply the sum of both waves at each point. | Section 5 |
| **Constructive interference** | When two waves add up to make a bigger wave — crests lining up with crests. | Section 5 |
| **Destructive interference** | When two waves cancel each other out — a crest meeting a trough. | Section 5 |
| **Interference pattern** | The characteristic pattern of bright and dark bands (or loud and quiet spots) that forms when waves from two sources overlap. | Section 6 |
| **Path difference** | The difference in distance from two sources to a given point. Determines whether interference is constructive or destructive at that point. | Section 6 |

### Standing Waves & Quantum (Sections 7-8)

| Term | Plain-Language Definition | First Used |
|------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Standing wave** | A wave pattern that appears to stay in place, with fixed points of zero displacement (nodes) and maximum displacement (antinodes). | Section 7 |
| **Node** | A point on a standing wave that never moves — always at zero displacement. | Section 7 |
| **Antinode** | A point on a standing wave with the maximum displacement. | Section 7 |
| **Fundamental frequency** | The lowest frequency at which a string (or any bounded system) can vibrate — the simplest standing wave. | Section 7 |
| **Harmonic** | A vibration mode at an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. The 2nd harmonic is 2×, the 3rd is 3×, etc. | Section 7 |
| **Resonance** | When an external force vibrates a system at its natural frequency, causing a dramatic increase in amplitude. | Section 7 |
| **Wave function (ψ)** | A mathematical description of a quantum particle. It doesn't tell you WHERE the particle is — it tells you the probability of FINDING it at each location. | Section 8 |
| **Probability amplitude** | The value of the wave function at a point. Square its magnitude to get the actual probability. | Section 8 |
| **Wave-particle duality** | Quantum objects (photons, electrons) behave like waves when unobserved (interference patterns) and like particles when detected (hitting specific spots). | Section 8 |
| **Quantization** | The constraint that only certain discrete values are allowed — like standing waves on a string, only certain wavelengths fit. | Section 8 |

## Terms to AVOID (or use only with immediate definition)

| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Sinusoidal | Jargon | "Wave-shaped" or "smooth repeating curve" |
| Oscillation | OK if defined | "Back-and-forth motion" |
| Propagation | Technical | "Travel" or "spread" |
| Eigenvalue | Far too technical | "Allowed value" |
| Hamiltonian | Way beyond scope | Don't use |
| Planck's constant | Not needed for conceptual treatment | "A tiny number that governs the quantum world" if mentioned at all |
| ℏ (h-bar) | Math notation | Avoid entirely |
