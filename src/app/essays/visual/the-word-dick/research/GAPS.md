# Research Gaps: The Word That Changed Its Stripes

> Documenting what we don't know or couldn't verify

## Known Unknowns

### Gap 1: Exact Origin of Anatomical Meaning

| Question | Why It Matters | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Why did "dick" specifically become anatomical slang? | Would explain the mechanism | UNRESOLVED |

**What we know**: 
- First documented 1891
- Possibly British army slang
- Pattern of male names → anatomy exists (john, peter, willie)

**What we don't know**:
- Was there a specific incident or cultural moment?
- Did it start in a particular regiment/region?
- Why "dick" completed the transformation when "bill" and "bob" didn't

**Recommendation**: Do NOT claim specific origin. Use phrases like "possibly," "may have emerged."

### Gap 2: Oral Usage Before 1891

| Question | Why It Matters | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| How long was the vulgar meaning in circulation before Farmer documented it? | Affects timeline accuracy | UNRESOLVED |

**What we know**:
- 1891 is first PRINT documentation
- Slang typically circulates orally before documentation
- Some sources suggest "mid-19th century" origin

**What we don't know**:
- Actual first usage date
- Whether decades or years preceded documentation

**Recommendation**: State "first documented in 1891" rather than "originated in 1891."

### Gap 3: Detective Slang Etymology

| Question | Why It Matters | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| How did "dick" come to mean detective? | Secondary meaning origin | PARTIALLY RESOLVED |

**Theories**:
1. Shortened form of "detective" (most common explanation)
2. From Romani "dik" meaning "to look/see" (less supported)
3. From the character Dick Tracy (chronologically impossible—1931 vs 1908)

**What we know**:
- First attested 1908
- American usage primarily

**What we don't know**:
- Definitive etymology

**Recommendation**: Present the "shortened detective" explanation as most accepted, note alternative exists.

### Gap 4: Why Bill and Bob Didn't Transform

| Question | Why It Matters | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Why did Dick become vulgar while Bill and Bob remained names? | Pattern explanation | UNRESOLVED |

**Observations**:
- All three follow same rhyming pattern
- All three were extremely common
- Only Dick completed vulgarization

**Possible factors**:
- Phonetic similarity to existing vulgar words?
- Random linguistic chance?
- Specific cultural/military context for "dick"?

**Recommendation**: Note this as linguistically interesting but unexplained.

### Gap 5: International Comparisons

| Question | Why It Matters | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Did similar patterns occur in other languages? | Broader linguistic context | NOT RESEARCHED |

**What we didn't research**:
- German "Richard" nicknames
- French "Richard" → "Ricard" patterns
- Whether name → slang pattern is English-specific

**Recommendation**: Keep essay focused on English. Don't speculate about other languages.

## Verification Limitations

### OED Access
- Full OED requires subscription
- Used secondary citations (Etymonline, Grammarphobia)
- Direct OED verification would strengthen claims

### Historical Figure Quotes
- Francis Grose dictionary preface quote: Verified
- Richard I "sell London" quote: Attributed (common but unverified primary source)
- Eric Partridge slang pattern quote: Attributed (common paraphrase, may not be exact)

### SSA Data
- Wikipedia cites SSA but direct SSA database search not performed
- "Fewer than 5 babies" claim from Wikipedia, not verified against SSA directly

## Content Warnings

### Claims to Avoid

| Claim | Reason | Alternative |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| "Dick originated in the military" | Uncertain | "May have emerged from military slang" |
| "The meaning changed in [specific year]" | Gradual process | "By the [era], the meaning had shifted" |
| "Richard I invented the rhyming pattern" | No evidence | "Names like Richard's generated nicknames through..." |
| "Everyone stopped using the name after X" | Gradual | "Usage declined significantly" |

### Sensitive Framing
- This is etymology, not vulgarity for its own sake
- Frame as linguistic scholarship throughout
- Avoid gratuitous repetition of the vulgar meaning
- Focus on transformation process, not shock value

## Recommendations for Spec

1. **Don't claim British army origin as fact** — use "possibly" or "may have"
2. **Distinguish documentation date from origin date** — 1891 is attestation, not invention
3. **Present detective etymology honestly** — most common theory, not certain
4. **Note the Bill/Bob mystery** — interesting but unexplained
5. **Use "declined" not "died"** — some usage persists
6. **Verify quotes in production** — especially attributed ones
