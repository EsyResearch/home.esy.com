            In the winter of 1947, inside a cramped laboratory at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, 
            New Jersey, two physicists did something that would reshape human civilization. 
            John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, working under the direction of William Shockley, 
            demonstrated a device that could amplify an electrical signal using a solid 
            piece of material—no vacuum tube required.

          <p className="sr-body">
            They called it a <strong>transistor</strong>. It was ugly, unreliable, and almost no one
            outside the lab understood what it meant. Within two decades, it would
            make vacuum tubes obsolete. Within five decades, billions of transistors
            would fit on a chip smaller than a fingernail.

            The transistor solved a problem that had plagued electronics since its birth: 
            vacuum tubes were hot, fragile, power-hungry, and unreliable. A computer built 
            from vacuum tubes filled a room and required constant maintenance. The transistor 
            promised something different—a switch with no moving parts, no heated filament, 
            no glass envelope waiting to crack.
          </p>
          
          <p className="sr-body">
            But the transistor almost didn't happen. The team's leader, William Shockley, 
            was brilliant and impossible. His theoretical insights guided the work, but his 
            abrasive personality drove talent away. When Shockley later founded his own 
            company in California, his management style would trigger an exodus—eight 
            engineers leaving at once, an act so shocking it earned them a name: 
            <strong> the Traitorous Eight</strong>.

            other two terminals (source and drain). Think of it like a dam: a small amount

            semiconductor industry has spent seventy years making transistors smaller. 
            Smaller transistors switch faster, use less power, and cost less per unit. 
            The relentless drive toward miniaturization isn't about elegance—it's about physics.

            They called it <strong>Intel</strong>—a contraction of "integrated electronics." Their initial

            Busicom wanted a set of chips for a new calculator. Ted Hoff, an Intel 
            engineer, proposed a radical alternative: instead of building custom chips 
            for each function, why not build a single chip that could be <em>programmed</em> to 
            do anything? A general-purpose processor. A computer on a chip.

            The <strong>Intel 4004</strong>, released in November 1971, was the world's first commercial
            microprocessor. It had 2,300 transistors and ran at 740 kHz. Today's
            processors have billions of transistors and run thousands of times faster.
            But the 4004 established the template: a programmable chip that could execute
            stored instructions.

            Intel's success wasn't guaranteed. The company nearly died in the memory 
            business when Japanese competitors undercut them on price. Andy Grove, 
            Intel's CEO, made a brutal decision: abandon memory and bet everything on 
            microprocessors. It was the right call. When IBM chose Intel's 8088 chip 
            for the first IBM PC in 1981, Intel became the engine of the personal 
            computer revolution.

          <p className="sr-body">
            For decades, the semiconductor industry operated on a simple model: if you 
            designed chips, you also manufactured them. Companies like Intel, Texas 
            Instruments, and Motorola ran their own fabrication plants—"fabs"—at 
            enormous cost. Building a new fab required billions of dollars and years 
            of construction.
          </p>
          
          <p className="sr-body">
            Morris Chang saw a different model. What if a company <em>only</em> manufactured 
            chips—no designs of its own? A "pure-play foundry" that would fabricate 
            other companies' designs. This would allow small companies to create chips 
            without building billion-dollar factories.

          <p className="sr-body">
            In 1987, Chang founded <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)</strong>.
            The industry was skeptical. Who would trust their most valuable intellectual
            property to an outside manufacturer? But Chang's insight was correct. The
            foundry model enabled an explosion of "fabless" chip companies: Qualcomm, 
            NVIDIA, AMD (which later spun off its fabs), and eventually Apple.

            Making transistors smaller isn't just about cramming more onto a chip. 
            Smaller transistors switch faster and use less power. The economics are 
            compelling: twice as many transistors per square millimeter means roughly 
            half the cost per transistor. The industry has spent trillions of dollars 
            chasing this scaling.
          </p>
          
          <p className="sr-body">
            But physics pushes back. To print ever-smaller features onto silicon, 
            you need shorter wavelengths of light. The industry used 193-nanometer 
            deep ultraviolet (DUV) light for decades, pushing it far beyond its 
            natural limits through clever tricks. Eventually, those tricks weren't enough.
          </p>
          
          <p className="sr-body">
            The answer was <strong>extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography</strong>—light with a wavelength 
            of just 13.5 nanometers. EUV light is absorbed by air, so the machines 
            operate in a vacuum. It's absorbed by glass, so mirrors replace lenses. 
            The light source? Tiny droplets of tin vaporized by a powerful laser, 
            50,000 times per second.
