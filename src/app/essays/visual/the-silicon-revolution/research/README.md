## Key Findings

### Narrative Arc
The semiconductor story follows a clear progression:
1. **Invention** (1947) — Bell Labs transistor
2. **Industrialization** (1957-1971) — Fairchild, Intel, microprocessor
3. **Globalization** (1987-2010) — TSMC, foundry model, Asian manufacturing
4. **Reckoning** (2020-present) — Supply chain crisis, CHIPS Act, geopolitics

### Central Insight
The semiconductor industry is fundamentally a **manufacturing innovation** story more than an invention story. The transistor was invented once; manufacturing it at scale has been reinvented continuously for 75 years.

### Key Figures (12 profiled)
1. John Bardeen — Transistor co-inventor
2. Walter Brattain — Transistor co-inventor
3. William Shockley — Transistor co-inventor, inadvertent Silicon Valley founder
4. Robert Noyce — IC co-inventor, Intel co-founder
5. Gordon Moore — Moore's Law, Intel co-founder
6. Jack Kilby — IC inventor (Texas Instruments)
7. Ted Hoff — Microprocessor architect
8. Andy Grove — Intel CEO, operational genius
9. Morris Chang — TSMC founder, foundry model inventor
10. Jensen Huang — NVIDIA CEO, AI compute pioneer
11. Lisa Su — AMD CEO, turnaround leader
12. Peter Wennink — ASML CEO (EUV commercialization)

### Data Highlights
- Moore's Law held for ~50 years: 2,300 transistors (1971) → 80 billion (2023)
- TSMC controls 92% of advanced chip manufacturing (≤7nm)
- ASML is sole supplier of EUV lithography machines
- US share of global manufacturing: 37% (1990) → 10% (2024)
- CHIPS Act commitment: $52 billion

## Source Tier Distribution

| Tier | Count | Percentage |
|------|-------|------------|
| Tier 1 (Primary) | 8 | 35% |
| Tier 2 (Academic/Industry) | 12 | 50% |
| Tier 3 (Quality Journalism) | 4 | 15% |
| Tier 4 (Avoid) | 0 | 0% |

## Gaps & Limitations

See `GAPS.md` for full documentation. Key limitations:
- No verbatim transcripts from Bell Labs December 1947
- Some Shockley management incidents are secondhand
- Pre-1980 financial data incomplete
- TSMC internal culture based on interview reporting

## Usage Notes

- All quotes marked "attributed" are cross-referenced in multiple sources but may not be verbatim
- Timeline dates are verified; where sources conflict, most authoritative used
- Data visualizations should cite specific sources in captions
- Figure photos require licensing verification before production
