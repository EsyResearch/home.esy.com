# Research Gaps: The Silicon Revolution

> Documentation of what could not be verified and how to handle it

## Critical Gaps (Avoid Claims)

### 1. Verbatim Bell Labs December 1947 Conversations
**Gap**: No verbatim transcripts of what Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley said to each other during the transistor invention.

**Impact**: Low — we have documented quotes from later interviews and Nobel speeches.

**Workaround**: Use quotes from Nobel lectures and oral histories, not invented dialogue.

---

### 2. Shockley's Specific Management Incidents
**Gap**: Specific incidents of Shockley's toxic behavior are reported in biographies but lack primary documentation.

**Impact**: Medium — the narrative relies on his toxicity driving the Traitorous Eight to leave.

**Workaround**: Attribute to biographies (Leslie Berlin) rather than stating as verified fact. Use phrases like "reportedly" or "according to colleagues."

---

### 3. Exact Fairchild Founding Negotiations
**Gap**: The specific terms of the Fairchild Eight's departure and founding negotiations are not fully documented.

**Impact**: Low — the fact of the departure is documented; specific terms aren't needed for the narrative.

**Workaround**: State that they left and founded Fairchild; don't speculate on specific negotiations.

---

## Medium Gaps (Use Caution)

### 4. Pre-1980 Financial Data
**Gap**: SIA data and industry statistics are incomplete before 1980.

**Impact**: Medium — limits precision of early manufacturing share claims.

**Workaround**: Note data gaps in visualization captions. Use approximate language ("roughly," "approximately").

---

### 5. TSMC Internal Culture
**Gap**: TSMC's internal culture and decision-making processes are not well-documented outside of interview-based journalism.

**Impact**: Medium — Morris Chang interviews are available but may not represent full picture.

**Workaround**: Attribute claims to Chang's own statements; avoid claims about internal culture that aren't from primary sources.

---

### 6. EUV Development Timeline Details
**Gap**: Specific decision points in ASML's 20-year EUV development are not fully public.

**Impact**: Low — the overall timeline is documented; specific R&D decisions aren't needed.

**Workaround**: State that EUV took 20+ years to develop; don't claim to know specific internal decisions.

---

## Minor Gaps (Low Impact)

### 7. Exact Founding Dates
**Gap**: Some company founding dates vary by source (incorporation vs. first day of operations).

**Impact**: Low.

**Workaround**: Use year only ("founded in 1987") rather than specific dates.

---

### 8. Quote Attribution Precision
**Gap**: Some quotes are widely attributed but may not be verbatim.

**Impact**: Low — indicated in QUOTES.md with "attributed" status.

**Workaround**: Mark as "attributed" rather than "verified verbatim."

---

### 9. Geopolitical Meeting Contents
**Gap**: Contents of government meetings on semiconductor policy are confidential/classified.

**Impact**: Low — public statements and legislation are available.

**Workaround**: Use public statements, legislation text, and policy analyst interpretations.

## What NOT to Claim

Based on these gaps, avoid the following claims:

1. ❌ Exact words spoken at Bell Labs in December 1947
2. ❌ Specific incidents of Shockley mistreating employees (unless sourced)
3. ❌ Internal TSMC strategy discussions
4. ❌ Precise manufacturing share before 1980
5. ❌ Specific EUV development milestones that aren't public
6. ❌ Contents of classified government meetings
7. ❌ Exact founding dates (use years instead)

## What IS Safe to Claim

1. ✅ Transistor invented at Bell Labs in 1947 (well documented)
2. ✅ Shockley's reputation for difficult management (biographies, multiple sources)
3. ✅ Traitorous Eight left Shockley in 1957 (documented fact)
4. ✅ Moore's Law stated in 1965 (primary source available)
5. ✅ TSMC founded 1987, foundry model (documented)
6. ✅ EUV took 20+ years to develop (documented)
7. ✅ ASML is sole EUV supplier (documented fact)
8. ✅ CHIPS Act passed 2022 with $52B (government record)
9. ✅ TSMC produces 92% of advanced chips (industry analysis)
