## Visual Archaeology Findings

### Primary Materials
- **Paper and parchment**: Maps, treaties, diplomatic correspondence
- **Metal**: Brass military decorations, iron shackles, steel weapons
- **Leather and fabric**: Military uniforms, explorer gear, African textiles
- **Stone and earth**: African landscapes, colonial architecture, border markers
- **Photography**: Early documentary photography (silver gelatin, albumen prints)

### Historical Color Associations
The scramble was documented through early photography and cartography. Colors derive from:

1. **Colonial cartographic tradition**: European powers color-coded their territories
   - British: Deep crimson red `#8B0000`
   - French: Navy blue `#000080`
   - German: Iron gray `#434B4D`
   - Belgian: Burgundy `#722F37`
   - Portuguese: Forest green `#228B22`
   - Italian: Olive `#808000`

2. **Photographic palettes**: Sepia, warm blacks, aged cream
   - Early photography sepia `#8B7355`
   - Documentary black `#1A1A1A`
   - Aged paper cream `#F4E4C1`

3. **African resistance symbolism**: Ethiopian gold, earth tones
   - Ethiopian sovereignty gold `#FFD700`
   - Resistance amber `#FFB347`
   - African earth `#8B4513`

4. **Violence and reform**: Blood red, justice blue
   - Atrocity documentation `#8B0000`
   - Reform movement `#4169E1`

### Recurring Visual Motifs
- Continental outline of Africa as canvas for colonial claims
- Straight-line borders cutting through organic landscapes
- Before/after territorial maps
- Formal portraits (European leaders) vs. documentary photos (African subjects)
- Treaty documents and signatures
- Railroad tracks as symbols of extraction
- Rivers as penetration routes (Congo, Niger, Nile)

### Era-Specific Aesthetics

**1870s–1880s (Exploration Era)**:
- Sepia toning, heavy grain
- Expedition photography aesthetic
- Engravings and illustrated newspapers
- Victorian formal portraiture

**1885–1900 (Partition Peak)**:
- High-contrast black and white
- Documentary starkness
- Battlefield photography emerging
- Colonial propaganda imagery

**1900–1914 (Consolidation)**:
- Cleaner photography
- Administrative documentation
- Reform movement pamphlets
- Atrocity evidence photographs

## Proposed Color Palette

### Primary Colors

| Color | Hex | Subject Connection |
|-------|-----|-------------------|
| **Near Black** | `#0D0D0D` | Documentary photography; gravitas of subject matter |
| **Charcoal** | `#1A1A1A` | Elevated surfaces; early photographic plates |
| **Aged Parchment** | `#F4E4C1` | Treaty documents; period maps; colonial correspondence |

### Colonial Power Colors

| Color | Hex | Subject Connection |
|-------|-----|-------------------|
| **British Crimson** | `#8B0000` | British Empire territories (largest colonial power) |
| **French Navy** | `#000080` | French Empire territories |
| **German Iron** | `#434B4D` | German Empire territories; industrial colonialism |
| **Belgian Burgundy** | `#722F37` | Leopold's Congo; blood of rubber terror |
| **Portuguese Forest** | `#228B22` | Portuguese colonies (oldest European presence) |
| **Italian Olive** | `#808000` | Italian territories; defeat at Adwa |

### Semantic Colors

| Color | Hex | Subject Connection |
|-------|-----|-------------------|
| **Ethiopian Gold** | `#FFD700` | Ethiopian sovereignty; Adwa victory |
| **Resistance Amber** | `#FFB347` | African resistance; moments of triumph |
| **Reform Blue** | `#4169E1` | Congo Reform movement; justice; Morel/Casement |
| **Text Cream** | `#FFFDD0` | Period documents; readable text |
| **Muted Gray** | `#A9A9A9` | Secondary text; captions; dates |

### Contrast Verification
- Text primary on near black: Contrast ratio 15:1 ✅
- Text secondary on charcoal: Contrast ratio 7:1 ✅
- All combinations meet WCAG AA standards

## Typography Stack

### Display: Playfair Display Bold
**Why**: Victorian-era gravitas; appropriate formality for historical documentation; echoes period newspaper headlines and official proclamations. The high contrast and elegant serifs evoke the aesthetic of colonial-era printed materials without being ostentatious.

### Serif: Source Serif Pro
**Why**: Readable, journalistic authority; works well for extended historical narrative; has the heft of serious documentation while remaining highly legible on screens; complements Playfair without competing.

### Quotes: Libre Baskerville Italic
**Why**: Distinguished and attributable; the italic form creates clear visual differentiation for quoted material; Baskerville's Georgian origins place it historically before the scramble, suggesting timelessness and primary source authority.

### Technical/Data: JetBrains Mono
**Why**: Clear presentation of statistics, dates, casualty figures; monospace creates visual alignment for numerical comparisons; modern but functional—data is data.

### Captions/UI: Inter Medium
**Why**: Clean, functional, highly legible at small sizes; does not compete with period-appropriate display fonts; allows the historical content to breathe.

## Animation Philosophy

### Overall Tempo: **Measured and Documentary**
The subject matter demands respect and gravity. Animations should feel deliberate, not flashy—like pages of history turning, not entertainment spectacle.

- **Reason**: The scramble killed millions and reshaped a continent. Animation pacing must honor this weight.

### Reveal Style: **Fade with Subtle Rise**
Content emerges from darkness, rising slightly as it materializes—like documents emerging from archives, photographs developing in darkrooms.

- **Reason**: Evokes archival discovery; the reader is uncovering history.

### Parallax Intensity: **Moderate**
Maps and photographs layer with subtle depth, but never hyperactive. The effect suggests physical documents stacked on a researcher's desk.

- **Layer speeds**: Background 0.2x, Mid 0.5x, Subject 1.0x, Overlay 1.2x

### Scroll-Lock Philosophy
Scroll-lock sequences are reserved for:
- The hero partition animation (Africa filling with colonial colors)
- Key map comparisons (before/after)
- Statistical revelations (Maxim gun casualty disparity)
- Evidence sequences (handled with content warnings)

**Reason**: Scroll-lock creates powerful moments; using it sparingly preserves impact.

### Special Effects
- **Era transitions**: Subtle processing shifts as timeline advances (grain decreases, contrast sharpens)
- **Map territory claims**: Colors fill boundaries with fluid, claiming motion
- **Quote monuments**: Text reveals with deliberate stagger, allowing each word to land

## Visual Motifs

### Decorative Elements
- **Africa continental outline**: Progress indicator, section backgrounds
- **Colonial border lines**: Straight lines cutting through organic content = visual violence
- **Sepia grain texture**: Overlays for period feel (subtle, not overwhelming)
- **Treaty fragment aesthetic**: Document tears, ink texture, official seals

### Section Transitions
- Transitions evoke turning pages of historical documentation
- Era markers appear like date stamps on archival materials
- Map shifts create sense of rapid territorial change

### Progress Indicator Concept: "The Territorial Claim"
A simplified Africa silhouette fills with colonial power colors as the reader advances—visualizing the scramble itself. Chapter markers appear as year labels (1870, 1885, 1896, 1914).

**Subject-specific because**: The visual metaphor IS the subject. The reader literally watches Africa get partitioned as they scroll.

## Differentiation Check

### How This Differs From Other Esy Scrollytelling

1. **Archival documentary aesthetic**: Unlike illustrated stories, this is grounded in historical photography and cartography
2. **Multi-actor color coding**: The colonial power palette (British red, French blue, German gray, etc.) creates a unique visual language not used elsewhere
3. **Map-as-narrative-device**: The Africa outline serves both as progress indicator and central visual metaphor
4. **Era-based processing**: Images subtly shift in treatment (grain, contrast) as timeline advances—creating visual historiography
5. **Content warning integration**: Atrocity documentation requires explicit handling not needed in other topics

### What Makes This Design Unmistakably "Scramble for Africa"

- **The partition progress bar**: Anyone seeing it will recognize Africa being divided
- **Colonial power color palette**: The specific red/blue/gray/burgundy combination is unique to this colonial context
- **Documentary photography treatment**: Sepia-to-black-and-white processing echoes the era
- **Before/after map comparisons**: The visual shock of 10% → 90% European control

## Mobile-First Considerations

### Typography Adjustments
- Body text: 18px base (comfortable on small screens)
- Headlines: 2.25–2.75rem (impactful but not overwhelming)
- Quotes: 1.25rem with generous line-height

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements: 44px minimum
- Skip buttons for scroll-lock sequences: Prominent, bottom-right

### Animation Performance
- Limit parallax to 2 layers on mobile
- Reduce grain/texture complexity
- Pause off-screen animations

### Layout Transformations
- Split-screen → Stacked (image then text)
- Comparison panels → Vertical stack with year divider
- Timeline → Single-column with date markers
