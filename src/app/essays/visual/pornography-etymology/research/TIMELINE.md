## Era 2: Buried Knowledge (79 CE – 1819)

### August 24, 79 CE — Pompeii Buried
**Event**: Mount Vesuvius erupts, burying Pompeii and Herculaneum
- Preserved explicit frescoes, sculptures, objects
- Contents unknown to outside world for 1,700 years
- Accidental time capsule of Roman erotic art

- Commissioned by Charles VII of Naples
- Explicit materials discovered throughout
- Created scholarly need for neutral vocabulary

### 1819 — The Secret Cabinet
**Event**: King Francis I of Naples creates "Gabinetto Segreto"
- Explicit Pompeian artifacts sequestered
- Access restricted to "mature men of respected morals"
- Formalized separation of "obscene" from "archaeological"
- Scholars needed vocabulary to discuss contents professionally

## Era 3: Victorian Invention (1857)

### 1857 — Dictionary Entry
**Event**: "Pornography" enters English via *Medical Lexicon*
- Dr. Robley Dunglison's dictionary, 6th edition
- Definition: "A treatise on prostitutes, or on prostitution, in its sanitary relations"
- Medical/public health framing, not moral
- Source: Dunglison, *Medical Lexicon*, 1857

### August 1857 — Obscene Publications Act
**Event**: Lord Campbell's Act becomes law (UK)
- First comprehensive obscenity legislation in English law
- Empowered courts to seize and destroy obscene materials
- Created need for legal vocabulary around explicit content
- Coincident with dictionary entry (not coincidental)

**Event**: American dictionaries adopt term
- Webster's American Dictionary includes "pornography"
- Begins American usage trajectory
- Still primarily medical/scholarly context

## Era 4: Legal Evolution (1957 – 1973)

### 1957 — Roth v. United States
**Event**: Supreme Court rules obscenity unprotected by First Amendment
- 354 U.S. 476
- Justice Brennan's "contemporary community standards" test
- "Whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest"

**Event**: *Jacobellis v. Ohio* concurrence
- 378 U.S. 184
- Justice Potter Stewart's famous phrase
- Acknowledged impossibility of precise definition
- Became cultural touchstone for definitional difficulty

### 1973 — The Miller Test
**Event**: *Miller v. California* establishes current standard
- 413 U.S. 15
- Three-pronged test still in use:
  1. Appeals to prurient interest (community standards)
  2. Depicts sexual conduct in patently offensive way
  3. Lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value (SLAPS)
- Local community standards, not national

---

## Era 5: Digital Proliferation (1991 – Present)

### August 6, 1991 — World Wide Web Goes Public
**Event**: Tim Berners-Lee's WWW available worldwide
- Infrastructure for unprecedented content distribution
- Within years, becomes primary vector for adult content
- Transforms obscure term into common vocabulary

### ~1995-2000 — Search Engine Era
**Event**: "Porn" becomes top search term
- Compressed form replaces full word in common usage
- 4 syllables → 1 syllable (pornography → porn)
- Estimates: 30-40% of early web traffic adult-related
- Term enters mainstream vocabulary permanently

### ~2005-2010 — Compound Explosion
**Event**: "-porn" suffix detaches from sexual meaning
- "Food porn" (visually alluring food images)
- "Real estate porn" (aspirational property viewing)
- "Ruin porn" (aestheticized urban decay)
- "Poverty porn" (exploitation of deprivation imagery)
- "Doom porn" (apocalyptic content consumption)
- Semantic drift: "porn" = viscerally compelling viewing

### 2024 — Present State
**Event**: Ubiquitous yet undefined
- One of most searched terms globally
- Legal definition still relies on 1973 Miller test
- Compound forms normalized in mainstream media
- Word's marketplace origins largely forgotten
