# Visual Essay Invocation: SOLD — The Etymology of Pornography

> From ancient Greek slave markets to your search bar — the 2,500-year journey of a word born in commerce, raised in scandal, and transformed by technology.

---

## Layer 1: Strategic Foundation

### Project Title
**SOLD**
*The Etymology of a Forbidden Word*

### Executive Brief

Every word has a birthplace. This one was born in the slave markets of ancient Athens, where human beings were bought and sold like pottery. The Greek verb πέρνημι (pérnēmi) — "to sell" — gave rise to πόρνη (pórnē): literally, "one who is sold."

For 2,500 years, this word has traveled through empires, buried cities, courtrooms, and fiber optic cables. It was clinical vocabulary for Greek merchants. It was a medical term for Victorian doctors. It was an unsolvable puzzle for Supreme Court justices. And now it is one of the most searched words in human history.

**Emotional Arc**: From clinical → controversial → ubiquitous
**Stakes**: Understanding how language carries its origins, even when we forget them
**Transformation**: The reader sees everyday vocabulary as archaeology

### Visual Treatment Philosophy

**Medium**: Photorealistic with technical illustration hybrid
- Ancient era: Warm terracotta and parchment tones, Greek pottery aesthetics
- Victorian era: Formal sepia, leather-bound dictionary textures
- Legal era: Cold institutional gray, document photography
- Digital era: Screen-blue glow, interface elements

**Typography as Hero**: 
- Greek script (GFS Didot) prominently featured throughout
- Etymology trees and word morphology diagrams as visual centerpieces
- Dictionary entry styling for key definitions

**No imagery of**: 
- Anything explicit or suggestive
- Sensationalized visuals
- Clickbait aesthetics

---

## Layer 2: Technical Systems

### Scroll-Lock Specification

**Philosophy**: Scroll as revelation — each etymological layer unveiled through scroll progress

**Lock Zones**:
1. Hero etymology reveal (0-100vh lock)
2. Word morphology diagram (πέρνημι → πόρνη → πορνογράφος)
3. Victorian dictionary entry animation
4. "I know it when I see it" quote isolation
5. Etymology tree final assembly

**Behavior**:
- Lock duration: 150-300vh per major sequence
- Scroll input drives letter/word appearance, not time
- Skip affordance always visible (keyboard: Space/Escape)
- Smooth easing: 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)

### Parallax Depth System

| Layer | Speed | Content |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0 - Far Background | 0.1x | Greek geometric patterns |
| 1 - Mid Background | 0.4x | Era-specific textures (pottery, parchment, screens) |
| 2 - Subject | 1.0x | Typography, figures, diagrams |
| 3 - Overlay | 1.2x | Floating Greek letters, glyphs |
| 4 - Ambient | 0.05x | Subtle noise/grain texture |

### Themed Progress Indicator

**Concept**: Etymology Tree Growth

The progress bar is a growing etymology tree:
- Root appears at 0%: PIE *per-
- First branch at 20%: πέρνημι
- Second branch at 40%: πόρνη
- Third branch at 60%: πορνογράφος
- Fourth branch at 80%: pornography (1857)
- Full tree at 100%: modern compounds branching outward

**Visual**: Vertical tree on left margin, branches extending right as reader progresses

## Layer 3: Hero Architecture

### Scroll-Lock Hero Sequence

**Name**: "The Selling Root"
**Duration**: 100vh locked scroll

**Choreography**:

| Scroll % | Visual State | Typography State |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| 0-10% | Black void | — |
| 10-25% | Faint geometric Greek pattern emerges | — |
| 25-40% | Pattern intensifies, gold accents | Π appears, large, semi-transparent |
| 40-55% | Central glow builds | Ό Ρ Ν Η appear sequentially |
| 55-70% | Full word assembled | **Πόρνη** complete, centered |
| 70-85% | English translation fades in below | "one who is sold" |
| 85-100% | Kicker and subtitle appear | "A Visual Essay on Etymology" |

## Layer 4: Chapter Schema

### Chapter 1: The Marketplace

**Temporal Marker**: Athens, ~500 BCE
**Central Metaphor**: Words are commodities — language is born in transaction

**Visual Assets**:
- Greek geometric background patterns
- Pottery imagery suggesting agora commerce
- Greek typography prominently featured
- Warm terracotta and gold color palette

**Content Focus**:
1. The agora as birthplace of commercial vocabulary
2. πέρνημι (pérnēmi) — "to sell, to export"
3. πόρνη (pórnē) — "one who is sold" — the prostitute as commodity
4. Distinction from ἑταίρα (hetaira) — companion vs. merchandise
5. Language carries economic relationships

**Key Figure Profile**:

**Athenaeus of Naucratis** — *The Documenter*
- Greek-Egyptian author, c. 170–230 CE
- Preserved the term πορνογράφος in *Deipnosophistae*
- First known compound: one who writes about prostitutes
- *"The pornographoi wrote of the women who could be bought in the marketplace, their names and their prices."*

**Scroll-Lock Sequence**: "The Compound Birth"
- Scroll drives πόρνη + γράφειν → πορνογράφος assembly
- Letters float separately, combine on scroll
- Translation appears: "one who writes of those who are sold"

**Parallax Treatment**: 
- Background: Subtle meander pattern at 0.1x
- Midground: Pottery texture panels at 0.4x
- Subject: Typography and callouts at 1.0x

---

### Chapter 2: The Buried City

**Temporal Marker**: Pompeii, 79 CE – 1819
**Central Metaphor**: Preservation creates scandal — time buries, then reveals

**Visual Assets**:
- Volcanic ash texture, muted grays and ochres
- Museum interior atmosphere
- Locked door/cabinet imagery (metaphorical)
- Victorian-era excavation documentation

**Content Focus**:
1. Vesuvius erupts August 24, 79 CE — accidental time capsule
2. Explicit content preserved in volcanic ash
3. 18th century excavations unearth uncomfortable truth
4. King Francis I creates "Gabinetto Segreto" (1819)
5. Scholars need vocabulary to discuss finds professionally

**Key Narrative Beat**:
The problem wasn't what they found — it was what to call it. How do Victorian scholars write about Roman erotica without themselves becoming indecent? They needed a term that was clinical, classical, safely distanced from vulgarity.

They found it in the Greek.

**Scroll-Lock Sequence**: "The Secret Cabinet"
- Museum door slowly opens on scroll
- Interior revealed with tasteful shadows
- Text emerges: "accessible only to men of mature age and respected morals"

**Parallax Treatment**:
- Background: Ash/smoke texture at 0.1x
- Midground: Stone texture suggesting excavation at 0.4x
- Subject: Cabinet door animation at 1.0x

---

### Chapter 3: The Victorian Invention

**Temporal Marker**: England, 1857
**Central Metaphor**: Naming creates category — the word invents the crime

**Visual Assets**:
- Dictionary page textures, serif typography
- Legal document aesthetics
- Formal Victorian portraiture style
- Sepia and dark green color palette

**Content Focus**:
1. Dr. Robley Dunglison's *Medical Lexicon*, 1857 — first English dictionary entry
2. Definition: "A treatise on prostitutes, or on prostitution, in its sanitary relations"
3. Medical framing, public health vocabulary — not moral category
4. Same year: Lord Campbell's Obscene Publications Act
5. The word and the law arrived together — coincidence or coordination?

**Key Figure Profiles**:

**Dr. Robley Dunglison** — *The Definer*
- 1798–1869, English-American physician
- Personal doctor to Jefferson and Madison
- First to put "pornography" in English dictionary
- *"PORNOGRAPHY: A treatise on prostitutes, or on prostitution, in its sanitary relations."*

**Lord John Campbell** — *The Legislator*
- 1779–1861, Lord Chief Justice
- Authored Obscene Publications Act 1857
- Created legal framework for obscenity prosecution
- *"The measure was intended to apply exclusively to works written for the single purpose of corrupting the morals of youth."*

**Scroll-Lock Sequence**: "The Dictionary Entry"
- Scroll reveals dictionary page layout
- Entry animates letter by letter
- Medical definition appears, then fades to...
- Modern usage contrast appears below

**Visual Callout**: Side-by-side dictionary definitions
- 1857: "A treatise on prostitutes..."
- Present: [Current OED definition]

---

### Chapter 4: The Courtroom

**Temporal Marker**: United States, 1957–1973
**Central Metaphor**: Definition fails — law cannot name what it prosecutes

**Visual Assets**:
- Supreme Court architectural elements
- Legal document typography
- Judicial portraiture
- Cold institutional grays and blues

**Content Focus**:
1. *Roth v. United States* (1957) — obscenity unprotected, but what is it?
2. "Contemporary community standards" — definition that defines nothing
3. *Jacobellis v. Ohio* (1964) — the most famous admission of failure
4. "I know it when I see it" — Justice Stewart's surrender
5. *Miller v. California* (1973) — current standard, still subjective

**Key Figure Profile**:

**Justice Potter Stewart** — *The Honest Judge*
- 1915–1985, Associate Justice
- Authored most famous admission of definitional failure
- Later regretted the phrase, called it "the best I could do"
- *"I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it."*

**Scroll-Lock Sequence**: "The Admission"
- Black background, courtroom silence
- Quote appears word by word on scroll
- Final phrase isolated: "I know it when I see it"
- Pause, then context: "The Greeks had named it precisely. The law could not."

**Visual Callout**: The Miller Test (1973)
1. Appeals to prurient interest (community standards)
2. Depicts sexual conduct in patently offensive way
3. Lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value

---

### Chapter 5: The Digital Flood

**Temporal Marker**: 1991 – Present
**Central Metaphor**: Compression — words shrink as content explodes

**Visual Assets**:
- Early web interfaces (Mosaic, early browsers)
- Search bar imagery
- Digital noise/glitch aesthetic
- Screen-blue glow, dark backgrounds

**Content Focus**:
1. August 6, 1991 — World Wide Web goes public
2. Within a decade: one of most searched terms in history
3. Linguistic compression: pornography → porno → porn (6 → 3 → 1 syllables)
4. Statistics (carefully sourced)
5. The word that Victorian doctors invented for medical journals became... ubiquitous

**Scroll-Lock Sequence**: "The Compression"
- Word "pornography" displayed
- Scroll compresses it visually
- Letters fade: por-no-gra-phy → por-no → porn
- Timeline appears: 1857 → 1960s → 1990s

**Key Narrative Beat**:
The internet didn't invent pornography. It didn't even invent the word. But it compressed both — the word from six syllables to one, the content from locked cabinets to infinite accessibility.

---

### Chapter 6: The Semantic Drift

**Temporal Marker**: 2010s – Present
**Central Metaphor**: Detachment — the suffix leaves its origin behind

**Visual Assets**:
- Modern media/food/architecture imagery
- Typography showcasing compound words
- Clean, contemporary aesthetic
- Full color, present-day visual language

**Content Focus**:
1. "-porn" as productive suffix, detached from sexual meaning
2. "Food porn" — visually alluring food images (normalized in media)
3. "Ruin porn" — aestheticized urban decay photography
4. "Poverty porn" — exploitation of deprivation imagery
5. The word that meant "selling" now means "selling attention"

**Visual Grid**: Compound Words
| Compound | Meaning | Year Coined |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| food porn | Visually alluring food | ~2006 |
| ruin porn | Aestheticized decay | ~2009 |
| poverty porn | Exploitation of poor | ~2008 |
| doom porn | Apocalyptic content | ~2010s |

**Scroll-Lock Sequence**: "The Etymology Tree"
- Full tree assembles on scroll
- PIE root at bottom
- Branches grow upward through eras
- Modern compounds branch outward at top
- Final state: complete visual etymology

---

### Epilogue: What Words Carry

**No temporal marker — universal**
**Central Metaphor**: Etymology as archaeology — dig into a word, find a civilization

**Content Focus**:
1. Every word carries its history
2. This one carries 2,500 years of commerce, shame, and adaptation
3. The marketplace where it was born — πέρνημι, to sell — echoes in every usage
4. Whether we acknowledge it or not

**Closing Typography**:
```
Πόρνη

one who is sold

The word in your vocabulary represents millennia of human transaction.
Language evolves. Etymology persists.

You will never read the word the same way.
```
