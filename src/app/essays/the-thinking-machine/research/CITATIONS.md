## Research Notes

### Verification Status
All primary papers verified through academic databases (ACM, IEEE, arXiv). Historical sources cross-referenced with multiple authoritative histories. Museum archives confirmed through institutional websites.

### AI Winter Causes
- First Winter (1974–1980): Overpromising, computational limitations, Minsky's critique
- Second Winter (1987–1993): Expert systems failed to scale, couldn't handle uncertainty

### Deep Learning Revolution
ImageNet 2012 moment widely recognized as inflection point:
- AlexNet achieved 15.3% error rate (vs. 26% previous best)
- Used GPUs, deep CNNs, dropout
- Sparked industry-wide adoption

### Transformer Impact
"Attention Is All You Need" (2017) enabled:
- BERT (2018)
- GPT-2 (2019)
- GPT-3 (2020)
- All modern large language models
