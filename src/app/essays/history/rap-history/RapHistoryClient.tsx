When Caribbean immigrants brought these traditions to New York, they carried the seeds of something new.",

The dancers who waited for these breaks became known as break-boys and break-girls. The culture was forming.",
      "Herc's MCs, Coke La Rock and Clark Kent, would toast over the beats—hyping the crowd, shouting out friends, keeping the energy high. This call-and-response between DJ and MC became the foundation of hip-hop performance.",

Grand Wizard Theodore accidentally discovered scratching while trying to hold a record still. Afrika Bambaataa, a former gang leader, saw hip-hop's potential to redirect youth energy and founded the Universal Zulu Nation."

The real revolution came when Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin founded Def Jam in a NYU dorm room in 1984. Their philosophy was radical: don't soften hip-hop for the mainstream.

'3 Feet High and Rising' (1989) sampled everything from Steely Dan to Johnny Cash."
