# Research Gaps & Uncertainties

> Compiled: December 2025
> Purpose: Document what CANNOT be claimed with confidence

---

## CRITICAL RULE

**Do NOT make claims about topics listed here without explicit uncertainty framing.**

Use phrases like:
- "Current evidence suggests..."
- "Most researchers believe..."
- "This remains debated..."
- "Evidence is limited for..."

---

## 1. TAXONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES

### Species Definitions
- **H. habilis validity:** Some researchers argue it's too heterogeneous to be a single species
- **H. heidelbergensis:** Taxonomic wastebasket; may include multiple lineages
- **H. ergaster vs H. erectus:** Some treat as same species; others distinguish African/Asian
- **Homo vs Australopithecus boundary:** Criteria for Homo genus membership debated

### Specific Taxa
| Species | Issue | Note |
|---------|-------|------|
| Sahelanthropus | Hominin status debated | Femur suggests quadrupedalism? |
| Orrorin | Limited material | Only femur fragments |
| Kenyanthropus | Validity questioned | Distorted cranium |
| Homo floresiensis ancestry | Unclear | Dwarf erectus? Primitive lineage? |

### DO NOT CLAIM:
- Definitive ancestor-descendant relationships between species
- Single linear progression from one species to another
- Exact species attribution for fragmentary fossils

---

## 2. DATING UNCERTAINTIES

### Contested Dates
| Specimen/Site | Issue | Range |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Homo floresiensis extinction | Revised 2016 | Was 12 ka → now 50 ka |
| Homo naledi age | Surprisingly young | 335-236 ka (unexpected) |
| Homo luzonensis | Uranium uptake issues | 67 ka → possibly 130+ ka |
| Ngandong (H. erectus) | Contested | 27-108 ka (some say 117 ka) |
| Fire at Chesowanja | Natural vs controlled? | ~1.4 Ma debated |

### DO NOT CLAIM:
- Precise single-year dates for fossils
- Exact timing of extinctions
- Specific dates for behavioral innovations without error ranges

---

## 3. BEHAVIORAL UNCERTAINTIES

### Symbolic Behavior
- **Ochre use:** Utilitarian (adhesive, insect repellent) vs. symbolic (decoration) unclear
- **Patterns on ochre:** By-products of use vs. intentional designs debated
- **Neanderthal symbolism:** Cave art attribution contested (Ardales, Maltravieso)
- **Body painting evidence:** Nearly impossible to verify archaeologically

### Fire Control
- Evidence before Wonderwerk Cave (1 Ma) is contested
- Distinguishing natural fire from controlled fire is difficult
- Cooking vs. other fire uses hard to separate

### DO NOT CLAIM:
- "First" symbolic behavior at any specific date
- Definitive cognitive interpretations from artifacts
- Specific purposes for ochre without qualification

---

## 4. GENETIC UNCERTAINTIES

### Admixture
| Topic | Issue |
|-------|-------|
| Neanderthal % in Africans | Recently discovered; estimates vary (0.3-1%) |
| African ghost population | No fossil DNA; inferred only from modern genomes |
| Denisovan % | Wide range (1.9-6% Melanesians) due to methods |
| Multiple Denisovan populations | At least 2-3; possibly more unknown |

### Ancient DNA Gaps
- **Africa:** Worst preservation; very limited aDNA
- **South/Southeast Asia:** Limited sampling
- **Pre-100 ka:** Almost no ancient human DNA
- **Phenotype inference:** Very limited for most traits

### DO NOT CLAIM:
- Single percentage values for admixture (always give ranges)
- Phenotypic traits of Denisovans (almost no morphology known)
- Complete population history from genetics alone

---

## 5. MIGRATION UNCERTAINTIES

### Routes & Timing
| Migration | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| Southern vs Northern OoA route | Both possible; evidence mixed |
| Americas timing | 24-15 ka debated; earlier claims controversial |
| Coastal route to Americas | Plausible but evidence underwater |
| Multiple OoA dispersals | How many? 2? 3? More? |

### DO NOT CLAIM:
- Single definitive migration route
- Exact date of arrival anywhere
- Linear migration paths (reality was complex, with back-migrations)

---

## 6. ANATOMICAL UNCERTAINTIES

### Bipedalism
- Exact selective pressures driving bipedalism unknown
- Arboreal vs. terrestrial bipedalism origins debated
- Role of climate/habitat in bipedalism unclear

### Brain Expansion
- Specific causes of encephalization unknown
- Cooking hypothesis (Wrangham) plausible but not proven
- Social brain hypothesis difficult to test directly

### DO NOT CLAIM:
- "Bipedalism evolved because..." with single cause
- Direct cause-effect for brain size increase
- Specific cognitive abilities from endocast data alone

---

## 7. CLIMATE-EVOLUTION CONNECTIONS

### Avoid Climate Determinism
| Do NOT Say | Instead Say |
|------------|-------------|
| "Climate caused bipedalism" | "Climate changes coincided with..." |
| "Aridification drove brain expansion" | "Brain expansion occurred during a period of..." |
| "Savanna expansion forced tool use" | "Tool use appeared in environments that included..." |

### Why This Matters
- Human evolution is multifactorial
- Climate determinism has problematic historical associations
- Correlation ≠ causation

---

## 8. IMAGE/RECONSTRUCTION LIMITATIONS

### Facial Reconstructions
- Soft tissue unknown (lips, nose shape, ears)
- Skin/hair color rarely determinable
- Eye color almost never known
- Expressions are artistic interpretation

### Behavioral Scenes
- Postures, gestures speculative
- Social interactions imagined
- Environmental details often extrapolated

### MUST LABEL:
- All reconstructions as "Artist's reconstruction" or "Scientific reconstruction"
- AI-generated images as "AI-assisted"
- Avoid implying photographic accuracy

---

## 9. SPECIFIC CLAIMS TO AVOID

### Pseudo-scientific or Sensational
- ❌ "Missing link" language
- ❌ "More evolved" or "primitive" as value judgments
- ❌ Single "cradle of humanity" origin point
- ❌ Racial essentialism or typology
- ❌ Ladder-like evolution narratives
- ❌ Caveman caricatures
- ❌ Progress narratives

### Overconfident Statements
- ❌ "We now know that..."
- ❌ "Science has proven..."
- ❌ "The first human was..."
- ❌ Exact dates without uncertainty

---

## 10. WHAT WE GENUINELY DON'T KNOW

### Major Open Questions
1. What species made Lomekwian tools?
2. Why did Homo naledi survive so late with small brains?
3. What happened to Neanderthals? (Climate? Competition? Both? Neither?)
4. How many Denisovan populations existed?
5. What is the African ghost population?
6. When and how did language evolve?
7. What caused the symbolic explosion in Upper Paleolithic Europe?
8. Why are there no Acheulean handaxes in East Asia?

### These Are Not Failures
- Acknowledging uncertainty is scientific honesty
- "We don't know" is a valid and important answer
- Ongoing research means conclusions may change
