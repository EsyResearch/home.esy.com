---

## Hypotheses to Test

1. **Necessity as Invention:** Hip-Hop emerged specifically from the Bronx's conditions of disinvestment and abandonment—it was a survival strategy, not just entertainment.

2. **Jamaican Connection:** Sound system culture was a direct, not merely metaphorical, influence on Hip-Hop's birth through figures like Kool Herc.

3. **Community Technology:** Hip-Hop functioned as community-building infrastructure (gang truces, alternative identity, economic opportunity) before it was a commercial genre.

4. **Latino Contribution Underrecognized:** Breaking and early Bronx party culture had significant Puerto Rican and Latino involvement that is often underrepresented.

5. **Women's Marginalization:** Women were present from the beginning but systematically underrecognized and underrecorded.

6. **Global Adaptation:** Hip-Hop's global spread involved genuine transformation, not mere imitation—each scene developed local meaning.
