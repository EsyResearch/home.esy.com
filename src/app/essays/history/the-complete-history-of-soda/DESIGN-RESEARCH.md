# Design Research Report: The Complete History of Soda

**Date**: January 1, 2026
**Status**: Complete
**Gate**: G4 - Design Research
**Subject**: 260-Year Visual Journey from Scientific Discovery to Global Dominance

---

## Design Research Overview

This essay spans 260 years (1767-present) across 7 distinct historical eras, tracking the transformation of carbonated water from a scientific curiosity to a $400+ billion industry serving 1.9 billion daily. The visual identity must evolve through these eras while maintaining coherent narrative flow. The design challenge is to create a unique visual system that emerges from the HISTORY of soda as cultural phenomenon—not from soda as a beverage.

### Critical Anti-Patterns (FORBIDDEN)

| Pattern | Reason | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Rising bubble animations | Generic carbonation cliche | FORBIDDEN |
| Liquid fill effects | Tired soda metaphor | FORBIDDEN |
| Bubble-based data visualizations | Obvious and overused | FORBIDDEN |
| Pouring/filling timeline mechanics | Predictable | FORBIDDEN |
| Carbonation-themed scroll mechanics | Surface-level association | FORBIDDEN |

## Visual Identity Analysis

### Subject Matter Characteristics

**Subject IS**:
- A 260-year historical narrative of commercial transformation
- The story of scientific discovery becoming global industry
- A chronicle of American pharmacy culture and soda fountain social spaces
- A tale of brand building, marketing innovation, and consumer psychology
- Geopolitical history (WWII expansion, Cold War diplomacy)
- Material culture: glass, brass, marble, machinery, bottles

**Subject Is NOT**:
- Simply "fizzy water"
- A beverage advertisement
- A flavor experience
- A celebration of sugar consumption
- A brand promotional piece

### Visual Treatment Decision

**Primary Medium**: Photorealistic with Era-Appropriate Processing

**Rationale**:
1. 260 years of extensive photographic and archival documentation exists
2. Each era has distinct visual aesthetics that must be honored
3. The human stories (Priestley, Pemberton, Woodruff, Goizueta) require authentic portraiture
4. Material culture (soda fountains, bottles, factories) is visually rich
5. Era transitions create natural visual rhythm

## Typography Selection

### Typography Stack

**Display**: Playfair Display (400, 700)
- **Justification**: Rooted in 18th century typography traditions. Its high contrast between thick and thin strokes echoes the Spencerian script that Frank Robinson used for the Coca-Cola logo. Elegant enough for Victorian pharmacy signage, authoritative enough for modern headlines.

**Body**: Source Serif Pro (400)
- **Justification**: A transitional serif with excellent readability. Its rationalist clarity suits the scientific discovery narrative while remaining warm enough for human stories. Works across all 7 eras without anachronism.

**Quotes**: Playfair Display Italic (400)
- **Justification**: Distinguishes quoted speech (Priestley, Pemberton, Woodruff, Goizueta) with editorial elegance. The italic form suggests handwritten correspondence of earlier eras.

**Data/Technical**: JetBrains Mono (400)
- **Justification**: Statistics are central to this narrative—transistor counts become serving counts, prices become market shares. Monospace typography dignifies the data.

**Captions**: Source Sans Pro (400)
- **Justification**: Clean sans-serif for attributions and metadata. Recedes appropriately behind primary content.

### Period Typography Adjustments

| Era | Typography Treatment |
|-----|---------------------|
| Scientific (1767-1780s) | Caslon-influenced letterforms; scientific notation styling |
| Commercial (1783-1850) | Georgian trade card styling; ornate capitals |
| Pharmacy (1850s-1920) | Victorian display faces; Spencerian script influence |
| Brand Wars (1915-1960) | Art Deco display; streamlined modernist |
| WWII (1941-1959) | Military stencil influence; propaganda poster style |
| Cola Wars (1959-1990) | Bold confrontational type; 1980s commercial |
| Global (1990-Present) | Contemporary sans-serif; data visualization |

### Type Scale

| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| Hero Title | clamp(3rem, 8vw, 5.5rem) | 400 | 1.1 |
| Chapter Title | clamp(2rem, 5vw, 3.5rem) | 400 | 1.15 |
| Era Marker | clamp(4rem, 12vw, 8rem) | 700 | 1.0 |
| Body | 1.0625rem | 400 | 1.85 |
| Quote | 1.5rem | 400 italic | 1.6 |
| Data Numbers | clamp(3rem, 8vw, 5rem) | 400 | 1.0 |
| Captions | 0.875rem | 400 | 1.5 |

## Animation Philosophy

### Core Concept: "The Accumulation of Innovation"

This is the story of how small discoveries compound into global empire. Animation should feel like **accumulation**—each era building upon the last, each innovation adding to the whole.

**Animation Is NOT**:
- Carbonation/bubbles (FORBIDDEN)
- Liquid pouring (FORBIDDEN)
- Fizzing effects (FORBIDDEN)
- Effervescence metaphors (FORBIDDEN)

**Animation SHOULD**:
- Feel like HISTORY unfolding
- Evoke the WEIGHT of accumulated time
- Suggest TRANSFORMATION (materials changing, ideas spreading)
- Honor the GRAVITY of 260 years
- Create RHYTHM through era transitions

### Primary Animation Metaphor: "The Patent Archive"

Each scroll-lock sequence reveals content like **documents emerging from an archive drawer**—official papers, photographs, patent drawings, advertisements sliding into view. This metaphor:
1. Honors the documentary nature of the research
2. Creates consistent reveal mechanism across eras
3. Avoids liquid/carbonation cliches
4. Suggests the weight of historical record

### Scroll-Lock Sequence Philosophy

| Sequence Type | Duration | Metaphor |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| Hero Opening | 1200px | Descent into the archive |
| Era Transition | 800px | Turning a page in time |
| Figure Reveal | 600px | Portrait emerging from shadows |
| Data Visualization | 800px | Ledger entries tallying |
| Quote Monument | 400px | Document spotlight |

### Era Transition Treatment

Transitions evoke **the turning of a century**:
- Color grade crossfades (1200ms)
- Grain/texture adjustments
- Typography weight shifts
- Ambient sound change (if applicable)

| Transition | Method | Duration |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Scientific to Commercial | Copper warmth cools to Georgian green | 1200ms |
| Commercial to Pharmacy | Green deepens to brass gold | 1200ms |
| Pharmacy to Brand Wars | Grain reduces; chrome emerges | 1200ms |
| Brand Wars to WWII | Color desaturates; newsreel grain | 1200ms |
| WWII to Cola Wars | Grain to scanlines; saturation increases | 1200ms |
| Cola Wars to Global | Texture clears; clean contemporary | 1200ms |

### Parallax Depth System

| Layer | Name | Speed Ratio | Content |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Background | 0.2 | Era-appropriate texture, ambient grain |
| 2 | Environment | 0.4 | Setting context (brewery, pharmacy, factory) |
| 3 | Subject | 1.0 | Primary image, figure portrait |
| 4 | Overlay | 1.2 | Text, data visualizations |
| 5 | Ambient | 0.1 | Subtle atmospheric effects |

### Animation Timing

| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Scroll-lock zone depth | 800-1200px | Per sequence |
| Standard transition | 400ms | Element reveals |
| Long transition | 800ms | Era shifts |
| Easing (standard) | cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0) | Smooth entry/exit |
| Easing (dramatic) | cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55) | Reveals, surprises |
| Stagger (sequential) | 80ms | Multi-element reveals |

## Unique Visual Motifs

### 1. The Vessel Evolution

The glass vessel transforms across eras:
- **Era 1**: Scientific glass (bell jar, retort)
- **Era 2**: Torpedo bottle (Schweppes)
- **Era 3**: Pharmacy dispensing glass
- **Era 4**: Contour bottle (iconic)
- **Era 5**: Military-issue bottle
- **Era 6**: Aluminum can
- **Era 7**: Global multi-format

**Implementation**: Subtle vessel silhouette appears in each chapter transition, morphing to the era's characteristic form.

### 2. The Counter/Fountain as Social Space

The marble counter is the heart of Era 3—the pharmacy soda fountain as innovation hub. This motif can recur:
- First as scientific laboratory bench
- Then as pharmacy counter
- Then as factory assembly line
- Then as vending machine interface
- Finally as global distribution network

### 3. The Script Evolution

Typography as brand artifact:
- Frank Robinson's Spencerian script
- Victorian advertising type
- Art Deco modernization
- Corporate standardization

**Implementation**: Coca-Cola script appears at key moments, its styling adjusted to period.

### 4. The Patent Document

Innovation documented formally:
- Priestley's 1772 publication
- Schweppe's commercial patent
- Contour bottle patent (1915)
- Trademark registrations

**Implementation**: Document-style reveals for key innovations.

### 5. The Global Map

Geographic expansion visualization:
- Leeds to Geneva to London
- Atlanta to nationwide
- 64 WWII plants worldwide
- 200+ countries today

**Implementation**: Map animations showing spread without bubble metaphors—use territorial fill or network lines.

---

## Progress Indicator Concept

### Concept: "The Era Timeline"

**NOT bubbles. NOT liquid fill.**

A vertical timeline that fills with **era-specific color** as the reader progresses:

| Segment | Era | Color | Year Range |
|---------|-----|-------|------------|
| 1 | Scientific Discovery | Copper #B87333 | 1767-1783 |
| 2 | Commercial Pioneering | Georgian Green #4A5A4A | 1783-1850 |
| 3 | Pharmacy Golden Age | Brass Gold #D4AF37 | 1850s-1920 |
| 4 | Brand Building | Chrome Silver #C0C0C0 | 1920-1940 |
| 5 | WWII Expansion | Olive Drab #556B2F | 1941-1959 |
| 6 | Cola Wars | Red/Blue Split | 1959-1990 |
| 7 | Global Dominance | Clean White #F5F1E6 | 1990-Present |

**Visual Design**:
- Thin vertical bar on left edge (desktop) or top edge (mobile)
- Current era glows with era accent color
- Completed eras show "settled" state (reduced opacity)
- Hover reveals era name and date range
- Click navigates to chapter start

**Justification**: This is a TIMELINE essay. The progress indicator should visualize TIME, not carbonation.

---

## Data Visualization Approaches

### FORBIDDEN Approaches:
- Bubble charts
- Liquid fill charts
- Fizz particle visualizations
- Carbonation-themed anything

### APPROVED Approaches:

#### 1. The Ledger Counter
For statistics (1.9 billion daily servings, 5 billion WWII bottles):
- Numbers tick up like a mechanical counter
- Serif numerals with slight shadow
- No bubbles, no fizz—just the weight of accumulation

#### 2. The Territorial Map
For market share, global expansion:
- Geographic regions fill with brand colors
- No bubble overlays
- Clean territorial visualization

#### 3. The Timeline Bar
For price evolution (5 cents for 70 years):
- Horizontal bar extending through time
- Dollar amounts marked at key points
- Visual emphasis on the 1886-1959 stability

#### 4. The Dual Column
For Cola Wars market share:
- Two vertical bars (red/blue) showing relative heights
- Years marked on horizontal axis
- The "crossing" moment visualized

#### 5. The Document Stack
For bottle count, factory count:
- Visual representation as stacked documents/patents
- Each unit representing 1 billion, 10 plants, etc.

---

## Scroll Interaction Concepts (NOVEL)

### 1. The Archive Drawer

**Concept**: Content slides in from the side like documents being pulled from a filing cabinet.

**Implementation**:
- Left-side content emerges from off-screen left
- Right-side content emerges from off-screen right
- Creates sense of browsing through historical records
- No vertical floating (which could read as "bubbles")

### 2. The Era Crossfade

**Concept**: As user scrolls through era transitions, color grading shifts gradually.

**Implementation**:
- CSS filter adjustments based on scroll position
- Hue/saturation/brightness shift between era palettes
- Grain intensity adjusts (heavy in scientific era, none in modern)
- Viewer feels TIME passing, not beverage pouring

### 3. The Counter Reveal

**Concept**: Key statistics emerge like totals on a cash register or pharmacy ledger.

**Implementation**:
- Numbers build digit by digit
- Final total holds with emphasis
- Mechanical/archival feel, not liquid

### 4. The Geographic Spread

**Concept**: Map regions illuminate in sequence showing expansion.

**Implementation**:
- Countries/cities highlight as narrative reaches them
- Lines connect origin points (no bubble trails)
- Clean, cartographic aesthetic

### 5. The Figure Gallery

**Concept**: Historical figures presented as formal portraits emerging from shadow.

**Implementation**:
- Portrait starts in deep shadow
- Lighting reveals face and details
- Biographical text appears alongside
- Feels like entering a portrait gallery, not a beverage display

## Layout Pattern Strategy

### Recommended Patterns

1. **Full-Bleed Hero** (`pattern-hero-fullbleed`)
   - For: Opening sequence, major era introductions
   - Rationale: Establishes atmosphere before text

2. **Document Reveal** (`pattern-document-reveal`)
   - For: Patent documents, publications, telegrams
   - Rationale: Subject-specific to historical record

3. **Figure Portrait** (`pattern-figure-portrait`)
   - For: Key historical figures (11 total)
   - Rationale: Human-centered storytelling

4. **Split Compare** (`pattern-split-compare`)
   - For: Before/after, Coke vs Pepsi, taste test results
   - Rationale: Visual conflict inherent in subject

5. **Timeline Horizontal** (`pattern-timeline-horizontal`)
   - For: Era overviews, bottle evolution
   - Rationale: Time progression visualization

6. **Data Monument** (`pattern-data-monument`)
   - For: 1.9 billion, 5 cents for 70 years, 64 plants
   - Rationale: Statistics as dramatic revelation

7. **Quote Block** (`pattern-quote-block`)
   - For: Priestley, Woodruff, Goizueta quotes
   - Rationale: Human voice emphasis

### Pattern Rotation Rules

- Never use same pattern consecutively
- Alternate between high-intensity (hero, data) and low-intensity (figure, quote)
- Each chapter must use minimum 3 different patterns

---

## Mobile-Native Considerations

### Mobile-First Design

- All layouts designed for 375px width first
- Touch targets minimum 48px
- Scroll-lock sequences must have visible skip affordance
- Parallax reduced to 2 layers on mobile

### Typography for Mobile

| Element | Desktop | Mobile |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Hero Title | 5.5rem | 3rem |
| Era Year | 8rem | 4rem |
| Body | 1.0625rem | 1rem |
| Data Numbers | 5rem | 3rem |

### Touch Interactions

- Swipe gestures for horizontal timeline sections
- Tap to expand figure biographies
- Double-tap to skip scroll-lock sequence
- All interactive elements in thumb zone

### Performance Budget (Mobile)

- Max 3 simultaneous animations per viewport
- Images lazy-loaded with blur-up placeholders
- Grain effects disabled below 768px
- Video replaced with static frames on low-power mode

---

## Accessibility Requirements

### Reduced Motion

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .era-transition,
  .figure-reveal,
  .data-counter {
    animation: none;
    transition: none;
    opacity: 1;
    transform: none;
  }

  .scroll-lock-sequence {
    /* Present as static content */
    scroll-behavior: auto;
  }
}
```

### Screen Reader Support

- All scroll-lock content accessible as static narrative
- ARIA labels for progress indicator
- Figure alt text includes biographical context
- Data visualizations have text alternatives

### Color Contrast

- Minimum 4.5:1 for body text on all backgrounds
- Minimum 3:1 for large text (headlines)
- Era color accents never carry meaning alone
- All information available without color

## Uniqueness Verification

### Comparison to Previous Esy Essays

**NOT Like The Invention of Wine**:
- Wine uses bubble/fermentation animations; Soda forbids them
- Wine uses liquid fill metaphors; Soda uses document reveal
- Wine is single-era depth; Soda is 7-era breadth
- Wine color comes from grape/wine; Soda color comes from materials (brass, marble, chrome)

**NOT Like The Semiconductor Story**:
- Semiconductor uses tech/cleanroom palette; Soda uses historical material palette
- Semiconductor uses circuit trace motifs; Soda uses vessel evolution motifs
- Semiconductor uses "assembly" reveal; Soda uses "archive drawer" reveal
- Both are industrial histories, but materials and eras are completely different

**NOT Like The Scramble for Africa**:
- Scramble uses colonial map visualization; Soda uses commercial expansion maps
- Scramble palette is earth tones; Soda palette is material metallics
- Scramble focus is political; Soda focus is commercial/cultural
- Different emotional registers entirely

### Unique Elements

1. **7-Era Color Progression**: No other essay spans 260 years with distinct visual treatments for each era
2. **Vessel Evolution Motif**: The transforming glass container is unique to this subject
3. **Archive Drawer Scroll Mechanic**: Document-based reveals not used elsewhere
4. **Brand Conflict Visualization**: Red vs. Blue Cola Wars is subject-specific
5. **Material Metallics Palette**: Copper → Brass → Chrome color progression unique to this industrial history

### The Forcing Question

> "What interactive element in this story could ONLY exist in a story about the history of soda?"

**Answer**: The **Contour Bottle Recognition Challenge**—a scroll-lock sequence where the user scrolls through blackness while a bottle silhouette rotates, asking "Can you recognize it in the dark?" This recreates the 1915 design brief that created the most recognizable commercial object in history. It's not about carbonation; it's about the specific history of THIS product.

Secondary: The **79-Day Counter**—a visualization of New Coke's duration where days tick by with consumer complaint counts rising, culminating in the reversal. This moment could only happen in THIS history.

### Visual Identity Test

If all text were removed, would someone guess this is about the history of soda?

**Yes**:
- The 7-era color progression tells a story of historical transformation
- The vessel evolution motif (scientific glass → bottle → can) is recognizable
- The contour bottle silhouette is unmistakable
- The Coca-Cola red emerging in Era 3 and dominating Era 6 signals the subject
- The marble counter imagery signals pharmacy/soda fountain culture
