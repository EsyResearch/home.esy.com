# Research Gaps: Year Zero, Visualized

## Purpose

This document identifies claims that could NOT be fully verified and should NOT appear in the spec without additional research or appropriate hedging language.

---

## 1. Death Toll Precision

**Gap**: Exact death toll is uncertain

**What we can say**:
- "Nearly two million" (USHMM)
- "1.7 million" (common estimate)
- "Approximately 2.2 million" (Etcheson)
- "25-33% of population"

**What we cannot say**:
- Any single precise number as definitive
- Exact breakdowns by cause (execution vs. starvation vs. disease)

**Recommendation**: Present as range with methodology note

---

## 2. S-21 Survivor Count

**Gap**: Conflicting survivor counts

**Reported figures**:
- USHMM: "Only 12 prisoners are believed to have survived"
- Other sources: 7 survivors found at liberation
- DC-Cam: Up to 23 when Vietnamese arrived
- Some sources: 179 may have been released 1975-78

**Recommendation**: Use "approximately 12" with note on variation

---

## 3. Bombing-to-KR-Growth Causation

**Gap**: Scholarly debate unresolved

**What we can say**:
- Bombing occurred (2.7M tons documented)
- Khmer Rouge grew during bombing period
- Multiple scholars connect these facts

**What we cannot say**:
- Bombing "caused" the genocide (single-cause)
- Bombing was "the" decisive factor

**Recommendation**: Present as debated causation; cite multiple perspectives

---

## 4. Pol Pot's Inner Motivations

**Gap**: Limited first-person evidence

**What we have**:
- 1997 Nate Thayer interview (final public statements)
- Writings and speeches (ideological)
- Third-party accounts

**What we lack**:
- Deep psychological profile
- Private correspondence
- Unguarded personal reflections

**Recommendation**: Rely on documented statements; avoid psychoanalysis

---

## 5. Exact Evacuation Casualty Numbers

**Gap**: April 1975 evacuation deaths uncertain

**What we know**:
- 2 million people evacuated from Phnom Penh
- Deaths occurred during march (heat, exhaustion, execution)
- Hospitals emptied, patients forced to walk

**What we don't know**:
- Precise casualty count during evacuation itself

**Recommendation**: Use qualitative descriptions ("many died")

---

## 6. Vietnamese/Cham Victim Counts

**Gap**: Precise numbers for targeted groups uncertain

**What we can cite**:
- ECCC: "Almost all Vietnamese remaining in Cambodia were killed"
- Cham: 90,000-500,000 killed (wide range)
- Chinese: 200,000-300,000 killed

**Recommendation**: Present as ranges, cite ECCC language

---

## 7. Khmer Rouge Internal Decision-Making

**Gap**: Limited documentation of high-level meetings

**What we have**:
- Some party documents
- Confession records
- Tribunal testimony (decades later)

**What we lack**:
- Meeting minutes
- Real-time correspondence between leaders
- Unforced statements of intent

**Recommendation**: Base claims on documented evidence, not speculation

---

## 8. Khmer Language Transliterations

**Gap**: Some terms require linguistic verification

**Terms needing review**:
- Angkar (the Organization)
- Santebal (secret police)
- Various place names

**Recommendation**: Note in spec that Khmer script and transliterations require verification with Khmer linguists before publication

---

## 9. Image Licensing for Non-Wikimedia Sources

**Gap**: Some archives require permissions

**Verified CC/PD sources**:
- Wikimedia Commons (extensive)
- US Government (NARA, State Dept)
- ECCC public records

**Requiring permission verification**:
- DC-Cam archive photos
- Some USHMM materials

**Recommendation**: Image Research Expert phase should verify all non-Wikimedia sources

---

## 10. Post-1979 Casualty Figures

**Gap**: Ongoing conflict casualties uncertain

**What we know**:
- Conflict continued after 1979
- Refugee crises occurred
- Landmine contamination widespread

**What we lack**:
- Precise post-DK casualty figures
- Clear delineation of Vietnamese occupation casualties

**Recommendation**: Focus on qualitative description of ongoing suffering

## Summary

| Gap Category | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Death toll precision | Medium | Use ranges |

| Bombing causation | High | Present debate |
| Pol Pot psychology | Medium | Avoid speculation |
| Evacuation deaths | Low | Qualitative language |
| Minority victim counts | Medium | Use ranges |
| Internal decisions | Medium | Evidence-based only |
| Khmer language | Low | Flag for review |
| Image licensing | Medium | Gate 4.5 verification |
| Post-1979 figures | Low | Focus on patterns |

## Spec Guidance

When building the invocation spec, the following claims should be AVOIDED:

1. ❌ "Exactly X people died" (use ranges)
2. ❌ "The bombing caused the genocide" (use "contributed to")
3. ❌ "Pol Pot intended from the start to..." (use documented statements)
4. ❌ Single precise survivor counts without noting variation
5. ❌ Unverified quotes without attribution

All spec content should be traceable to sources in CITATIONS.md.
