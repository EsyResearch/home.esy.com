### 3. Genocide Definition and Findings

**Legal Framework**:
- UN Genocide Convention (1948) defines genocide as acts with **dolus specialis** (special intent) to destroy national, ethnic, racial, or religious groups
- Genocide requires **physical destruction** of the group, not just cultural destruction

**ECCC Genocide Convictions**:
- Nuon Chea: Guilty of genocide against **ethnic Vietnamese** AND **Cham Muslims**
- Khieu Samphan: Guilty of genocide against **ethnic Vietnamese**
- First genocide convictions by a hybrid international tribunal

**Key Distinction**: The Khmer Rouge committed both genocide (against specific protected groups) AND crimes against humanity (against broader population)

### 4. Bombing and Civil War Context

**US Bombing (1965-1973)**:
- **2.7 million tons** of ordnance dropped (Owen & Kiernan declassified data)
- More than Allies dropped on Germany in WWII
- 230,516 sorties over 113,716 sites

**Scholarly Debate on Causation**:
| View | Proponent | Argument |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Primary factor | Kiernan, Shawcross | Bombing destabilized Cambodia, boosted KR recruitment |
| Contributing factor | Etcheson | Bombing increased recruitment but internal factors primary |
| Defensive necessity | Rodman, Kissinger | North Vietnamese occupation was primary destabilizer |

**Essay approach**: Present all perspectives; avoid single-cause explanations
