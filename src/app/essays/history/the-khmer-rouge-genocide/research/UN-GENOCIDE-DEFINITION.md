### The Two Elements of Genocide

**1. Mental Element (Mens Rea):**
- The "intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such"
- This is called **dolus specialis** (special intent)
- Physical destruction is required - cultural destruction does not suffice
- Intent to disperse a group is not sufficient
- The intent must be to destroy the **group as such**, not merely its individual members

**2. Physical Element (Actus Reus):**
- The five acts enumerated exhaustively in Article II

### Protected Groups (The Four Categories)
Only **four types of groups** are protected under the Convention:
1. **National groups**
2. **Ethnical groups**
3. **Racial groups**
4. **Religious groups**

**Important note:** Political groups and "cultural genocide" are NOT included. This was a compromise during the 1948 negotiations.

### "In Whole or In Part" - The Substantial Part Requirement
- Perpetrators need not intend to destroy the **entire** group
- Destruction of only **a substantial part** of the group qualifies as genocide
- "Substantial" can be measured by:
  - **Quantitative criteria:** Number of victims relative to total group size
  - **Qualitative criteria:** Targeting emblematic members, leaders, or those essential to the group's survival
  - **Geographic criteria:** Destruction within a geographically limited area (e.g., Srebrenica)

### Group Membership - Subjective Classification
- Victims are targeted because of their **real or perceived membership** in a protected group
- The ICTR held that groups are classified **subjectively by perpetrators**, not objectively by social scientists
- Example: Tutsis were an "ethnic" group to their killers, even though some scholars classify them as a "caste"

### Comparative Analysis

| Aspect | Genocide | Crimes Against Humanity | War Crimes |
|--------|----------|------------------------|------------|
| **Context Required** | Peace or armed conflict | Peace or armed conflict | **Armed conflict only** |
| **Target** | Specific national, ethnic, racial, or religious group | Any civilian population | Combatants or non-combatants |
| **Key Mental Element** | **Dolus specialis** - specific intent to destroy the group | Knowledge of widespread/systematic attack | Knowledge of armed conflict |
| **Key Contextual Element** | Intent to destroy group "as such" | "Widespread or systematic attack" | Violation of laws of war |
| **Legal Codification** | 1948 Genocide Convention | Rome Statute Article 7 (not a dedicated treaty) | Geneva Conventions (1949), Rome Statute Article 8 |

### What Makes Genocide Unique - Dolus Specialis

**Dolus specialis** (special intent) is the defining feature that distinguishes genocide from other atrocity crimes:

1. **Beyond ordinary intent:** The perpetrator must not only intend to commit the prohibited act but must also possess the specific intent to destroy the targeted group
2. **Physical destruction required:** Intent to culturally destroy or disperse a group is insufficient
3. **Group-focused:** The destruction must target the group "as such," not merely individuals who happen to be members
4. **Difficult to prove:** Perpetrators rarely declare genocidal intent openly; courts often infer it from circumstantial evidence - "the pattern of acts should be such that it could only point to the existence of such intent"
