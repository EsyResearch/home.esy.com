## Special Research Considerations

### Death Toll Handling
- Present as range (approximately 1.5-2 million)
- Document methodologies (demographic reconstruction, grave mapping, testimony)
- Use USHMM baseline ("nearly two million") with scholarly ranges
- Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly

### Bombing Data Handling
- Use Owen & Kiernan declassified analysis as one source
- Present as "dataset-based estimate" with uncertainty annotation
- Include multiple scholarly perspectives on causal impact
- Note ongoing debate

### Genocide vs Crimes Against Humanity
- Use UN Genocide Convention definition precisely
- Document ECCC findings specifically (ethnic Vietnamese, Cham Muslims)
- Distinguish legal categories without minimizing any victims
- Show overlap of crimes

### Khmer Language
- All Khmer terms require verification before publication
- Note in GAPS.md any terms requiring linguist review
- Provide transliterations with standard romanization
