## Notes on Figure Discrepancies

1. **Death Toll**: USHMM uses both "nearly two million" and "at least 1.7 million" - both represent approximately 25-33% of Cambodia's population

2. **S-21 Survivors**: USHMM states "Only 12 prisoners are believed to have survived." Other sources cite different numbers:
   - 7 survivors found at liberation (commonly cited)
   - 12 survivors (USHMM figure)
   - Approximately 23 survivors when Vietnamese forces arrived (DC-Cam)

3. **Population Percentage**: USHMM cites both "at least a quarter" (25%) and "approximately one third" (33%) - reflects uncertainty in both death toll and base population
