## III. Scholarly Debate: Bombing's Role in Khmer Rouge Recruitment

### PERSPECTIVE A: Bombing as Primary/Significant Factor

**Ben Kiernan (Yale University)**
- *"The American Bombardment of Kampuchea, 1969-1973," Vietnam Generation (Winter 1989)*
  - URL: https://digitalcommons.lasalle.edu/vietnamgeneration/vol1/iss1/3/
  - Argument: Khmer Rouge "would not have won power without U.S. economic and military destabilization"
  - Khmer Rouge grew from ~1,000 in 1969 to 220,000 by 1973

**William Shawcross**
- *Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon, and the Destruction of Cambodia* (1979; revised 2002)
  - Argument: "Khmer Rouge were born out of the inferno that American policy did much to create"
  - Source Tier: Investigative journalism / primary source research

**Adam Jones** (*Genocide: A Critical Introduction*)
  - US bombing was "the most important factor in bringing the genocidal Khmer Rouge to power"

### PERSPECTIVE B: Bombing as Contributing but Not Primary Factor

**Craig Etcheson (DC-Cam)**
- *The Rise and Demise of Democratic Kampuchea* (1984; reissued Routledge, 2019)
  - Agrees bombing increased recruitment but disputes it was primary cause
  - Emphasizes internal ideological and structural factors
  - Source Tier: Academic monograph

### PERSPECTIVE C: North Vietnamese Occupation as Primary Cause

**Peter Rodman (Kissinger aide)**
- "What destabilized Cambodia was North Vietnam's occupation of chunks of Cambodian territory"
- Bombing targeted Vietnamese troops, not Cambodian civilians
- Sihanouk government acquiesced to bombing

### Key Supporting Evidence

**CIA Directorate of Operations Report (May 1973)**
- Communists using bombing damage as "main theme of their propaganda"

**US GAO Report (1971)**
- 60% of Khmer refugees cited US bombing as reason for displacement
