# Visual Essay Invocation: Year Zero, Visualized

**Cambodia's Civil War and the Khmer Rouge Genocide (1960s–1990s)**

---

## Layer 1: Strategic Foundation

### Project Title

**"Year Zero, Visualized: Cambodia's Civil War and the Khmer Rouge Genocide"**

### Executive Brief

Create an immersive, photography-driven visual essay that chronicles one of the 20th century's most devastating atrocities—the Khmer Rouge genocide that killed approximately 1.7-2 million Cambodians between 1975 and 1979. This experience uses archival photography, documents, and carefully curated memorial imagery to convey the human cost of ideological extremism while maintaining dignity for victims and survivors.

The narrative spans from the peaceful Cambodia of the Sihanouk era through the devastating civil war, the "Year Zero" revolution, the Vietnamese liberation in 1979, and the decades-long pursuit of justice culminating in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). Each chapter explores how Cold War geopolitics, internal political dynamics, and radical ideology converged to produce genocide—and why this history remains undertaught globally.

This essay matters now because genocide education remains Holocaust-centric in Western curricula, while Cambodia's 50 million young people grapple with inherited trauma. The ECCC's closure in 2022 marked the end of formal international justice; memory now depends on education, documentation, and understanding. The Khmer Rouge's utopian rhetoric echoes in contemporary extremism.

The reader who completes this essay will understand: how genocide unfolds through policy as much as violence; why the legal distinction between "genocide" and "crimes against humanity" matters; what justice looks like after mass atrocity; and why the history of a small Southeast Asian nation is inseparable from global Cold War dynamics.

### Visual Treatment Philosophy

**Non-Negotiable Constraints:**
- Trauma-informed design throughout
- No sensationalism or exploitation of suffering
- Click-to-reveal for all distressing imagery
- Citations and sources visible throughout
- No scroll-locking hero section
- Only licensing-safe images (Wikimedia Commons, public domain, properly licensed)

### Photography Across Eras

**Era 1: Pre-War Cambodia (1863–1969)**
- Color treatment: Warm sepia tones, archival texture
- Processing: Soft contrast, slight grain, golden warmth
- Sources: Wikimedia Commons historical photos, John Thomson 19th-century archives

**Era 2: Civil War (1970–1975)**
- Color treatment: High contrast black and white
- Processing: Heavy grain, stark shadows, war photography aesthetic
- Sources: Wikimedia Commons, NARA declassified images

**Era 3: Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979)**
- Color treatment: Stark, desaturated, document-heavy
- Processing: Clinical, cold, regime-aesthetic (ID cards, documents, confessions)
- Sources: ECCC public records, Wikimedia Commons Tuol Sleng category

**Era 4: Post-1979 (1979–1990s)**
- Color treatment: Recovery palette, muted but returning color
- Processing: Documentary journalism aesthetic
- Sources: Wikimedia Commons, UN archives

**Era 5: Justice & Memory (1990s–Present)**
- Color treatment: Contemporary documentary
- Processing: High-quality digital, courtroom documentation
- Sources: ECCC courtroom photos (129 files on Wikimedia Commons)

**Transition Treatment:**
Era shifts occur at chapter boundaries with subtle cross-fade of processing. Scroll position triggers gradual desaturation entering DK era; warmth returns post-1979.

## Layer 2: Technical Systems

### Scroll-Lock Animation System

**Critical Implementation:** Minimal scroll-lock policy per user specification. Only 1-2 critical moments use viewport locking, always with visible skip affordance.

**Required Behavior:**
- Scroll-lock reserved for maximum 2 sequences total
- Each lock includes prominent "Skip ↓" button (bottom-right corner)
- Lock duration: 800-1200px scroll depth maximum
- Smooth 400ms easing on lock/unlock transitions
- Reduced motion preference respected (locks become instant reveals)

**Scroll-Lock Techniques for This Essay:**
- **The Reveal**: Black overlay recedes to expose document/photo (S-21 chapter)
- **The Assembly**: Timeline builds piece by piece (Justice chapter)
- **The Comparison**: Before/after slider driven by scroll (limited use)

### Parallax Depth System

- **Layer 0 (Background):** Atmospheric texture—rice paper, stone, lacquer—slow-moving (0.3x speed)
- **Layer 1 (Mid-ground):** Supporting context photos, maps, documents (0.7x speed)
- **Layer 2 (Subject):** Primary narrative photos, figures, key evidence (1.0x, standard scroll)
- **Layer 3 (Overlay):** Citations, annotations, chapter markers, content warnings (1.0x, pinned sections)
- **Layer 4 (Ambient):** Subtle particle effects—dust motes, rain, document edges—very slow (0.2x)

### Progress Bar Design

**Concept: "The Memorial Stupa"**

The Choeung Ek memorial stupa—a tower containing victims' skulls—serves as the progress metaphor. The bar visualizes a vertical stupa silhouette that fills with light as the reader progresses.

**Design:**
- Position: Left edge, vertical, 60% viewport height
- Visual: Stupa outline (SVG) fills from bottom with warm gold light
- Chapter markers: Small horizontal notches at stupa's tiers
- Current position: Glowing tier indicator
- Micro-interactions: Hover on tier shows chapter title tooltip

**Data Structure:**
- Tier 1: Base foundation — "Prologue: The City Walked"
- Tier 2: First level — "Before Year Zero"
- Tier 3: Second level — "Cold War Spillover"
- Tier 4: Third level — "Civil War"
- Tier 5: Fourth level — "Year Zero"
- Tier 6: Fifth level — "Starvation as Policy"
- Tier 7: Sixth level — "S-21: Bureaucracy of Terror"
- Tier 8: Seventh level — "What Is Genocide?"
- Tier 9: Eighth level — "The World Outside"
- Tier 10: Ninth level — "After 1979"
- Tier 11: Tenth level — "Justice & Memory"

## Layer 3: Hero Architecture

### Hero Section Specification

**CONSTRAINT: No Scroll-Lock Hero**

Per user specification, the hero does NOT use scroll-locking. Instead, it provides an immediate, static, dignified entry point.

### Visual Concept: "Stone and Sky"

The hero presents the Choeung Ek memorial stupa exterior against a clouded sky—a monument to memory, not graphic imagery. Text overlays introduce the essay's scope without animation gimmicks.

**Static Hero Design:**

- **Background:** Choeung Ek stupa exterior photograph (CC BY-SA, Adam Jones)
- **Overlay:** Semi-transparent gradient from bottom (lacquer black 80% → transparent)
- **Typography:** Title in dignified serif, subtitle in readable sans
- **Entry CTA:** "Begin reading ↓" with subtle pulse animation
- **Content Warning:** Visible before scroll—"This essay contains descriptions of genocide, mass violence, and human suffering. Distressing images are hidden behind click-to-reveal controls."

**Title Card:**

## Layer 4: Chapter Schema

### Chapter 0: Prologue — The City Walked
*April 17, 1975*

**Metaphor:** The day a city emptied itself at gunpoint

**Central Photographs:**
- Phnom Penh street scene pre-1975 (peaceful urban life)
- Forced evacuation imagery (masses walking on roads)
- Hospital patients being evacuated
- Khmer Rouge soldiers entering capital

**Content Focus:**
On April 17, 1975, Khmer Rouge forces entered Phnom Penh. Within hours, they ordered the complete evacuation of the capital—approximately 2 million people forced onto roads with no warning, no preparation, and no return date. Hospitals were emptied; patients on IV drips pushed their own gurneys. This was the first act of Year Zero: the city was a disease to be cured by erasure.

The evacuation killed unknown thousands through heat, exhaustion, and execution. Families were separated. The urban population—educated, connected to the old regime simply by living in cities—was marked as corrupted.

**Key Figure Profile:**

**Norodom Sihanouk** — The King Who Allied with His Destroyers
- Ruled as king and head of state (1941–1970)
- Deposed in 1970 coup by Lon Nol while abroad
- Formed alliance with Khmer Rouge against Lon Nol
- Became ceremonial head of state for Khmer Rouge (1975–1976)
- Later admitted: "Yes, I had my part also in the mistake"
- Photograph: 1963 official portrait, formal attire

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: None**
(Prologue uses standard scroll with parallax)

**Parallax Treatment:**
- Background: Phnom Penh city skyline (Layer 0)
- Mid-ground: Evacuation columns (Layer 1)
- Subject: Individual family photographs (Layer 2)
- Overlay: Date stamp, citation block (Layer 3)

### Chapter 1: Before Year Zero
*1863–1969*

**Metaphor:** The nation before its erasure

**Central Photographs:**
- Angkor Wat at sunrise (cultural touchstone)
- Tonlé Sap floating villages
- Pre-war Phnom Penh architecture
- Norodom Sihanouk in diplomatic settings

**Content Focus:**
Cambodia's identity was forged by empire (Angkor), colonialism (French Indochina, 1863–1953), and independence under Sihanouk. The Tonlé Sap's unique reversing flow made Cambodia an agricultural heartland. Sihanouk's "Buddhist socialism" attempted neutrality as the Vietnam War engulfed neighbors.

This chapter establishes what was lost: a functioning society, a culture, a people's way of life. The Khmer Rouge would attempt to restart history at Year Zero—but history is not so easily erased.

**Key Figure Profile:**

**Norodom Sihanouk** — The Mercurial King
- Led Cambodia to independence from France (1953)
- Pursued neutrality in Cold War via "Buddhist socialism"
- Survived multiple coups and returned to power repeatedly
- Complex legacy: modernizer, authoritarian, survivor
- "In the interests of my nation, I would shake hands with the devil"
- Photograph: Meeting with JFK (1961), Wikimedia Commons PD (US Gov)

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: None**

**Parallax Treatment:**
- Background: Angkor Wat silhouette (Layer 0, warm sepia)
- Mid-ground: Tonlé Sap waters (Layer 1)
- Subject: Sihanouk-era photographs (Layer 2)
- Ambient: Lotus petal particles (Layer 4)

### Chapter 2: Cold War Spillover
*1965–1973*

**Metaphor:** Bombs as seeds of revolution

**Central Photographs:**
- B-52 bomber archival imagery
- Map of bombing sites (230,516 sorties)
- Cambodian rural landscape with bomb craters
- Declassified Operation Menu documents

**Content Focus:**
The United States dropped 2.7 million tons of ordnance on Cambodia between 1965 and 1973—more than the Allies dropped on Germany in World War II. This included secret bombing campaigns (Operation Menu, 1969–1970) and overt campaigns (Operation Freedom Deal, 1970–1973). The bombs killed tens of thousands of civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands more.

**Scholarly Debate on Causation:**
| View | Proponent | Argument |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Primary factor | Kiernan, Shawcross | Bombing destabilized Cambodia, boosted KR recruitment |
| Contributing factor | Etcheson | Bombing increased recruitment but internal factors primary |
| Defensive necessity | Rodman, Kissinger | North Vietnamese occupation was primary destabilizer |

This chapter presents all perspectives without single-cause determinism. The bombing did not "cause" the genocide—but it helped create the conditions from which the Khmer Rouge emerged.

**Key Figure Profile:**

**Henry Kissinger** — The Architect Abroad
- US National Security Advisor (1969–1975)
- Ordered secret Cambodia bombing expansion
- Nobel Peace Prize recipient (1973)
- Controversial legacy regarding Cambodian civilian deaths
- Never faced tribunal for Cambodia policies
- Photograph: Official State Department portrait, PD (US Gov)

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: "The Tonnage"**

Minimal scroll-lock (optional): Scroll reveals bomb tonnage counter rising from 0 to 2.7 million as map fills with strike markers.

- **0-30% scroll:** Map of Cambodia appears, clean
- **30-70% scroll:** Strike markers accumulate; counter rises
- **70-90% scroll:** Counter reaches 2.7 million; zoom to single crater
- **90-100% scroll:** Return to full map, now scarred

**Skip affordance:** Visible "Skip ↓" button throughout

**Parallax Treatment:**
- Background: Cloud cover, smoke (Layer 0)
- Mid-ground: Falling ordnance silhouettes (Layer 1, very subtle)
- Subject: Declassified documents, maps (Layer 2)
- Overlay: Citation: Owen & Kiernan, 2006 (Layer 3)

### Chapter 3: Civil War
*1970–1975*

**Metaphor:** The furnace that forged the revolution

**Central Photographs:**
- Lon Nol coup imagery (March 1970)
- Civil war frontlines
- Refugees fleeing to Phnom Penh
- Khmer Rouge fighters

**Content Focus:**
In March 1970, while Sihanouk was abroad, General Lon Nol deposed him in a coup backed by the United States. Sihanouk, from Beijing, called on Cambodians to join the Khmer Rouge resistance. The civil war that followed killed an estimated 500,000 people and displaced millions.

By 1975, Phnom Penh was swollen with refugees—2 million people in a city built for 600,000. The Khmer Rouge controlled most of the countryside. On April 17, they entered the capital.

**Key Figure Profile:**

**Lon Nol** — The General Who Fell
- Led March 1970 coup deposing Sihanouk
- Established Khmer Republic with US backing
- Suffered stroke (1971) but continued to lead
- Fled to Hawaii before Phnom Penh fell (April 1975)
- Died in exile (1985)
- Photograph: Official military portrait, Wikimedia Commons

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: None**

**Parallax Treatment:**
- Background: Smoke, fire (Layer 0, high contrast B&W)
- Subject: Frontline photographs (Layer 2)
- Overlay: Refugee statistics (Layer 3)

### Chapter 4: Year Zero
*April 1975 – December 1978*

**Metaphor:** History restarted at gunpoint

**Central Photographs:**
- Democratic Kampuchea flag (SVG, PD)
- DK Zone administrative map (PD)
- Collectivized agriculture imagery
- Destroyed currency, books, religious items

**Content Focus:**
The Khmer Rouge declared "Year Zero"—a complete reset of Cambodian society. Their policies:
- **Abolition of money, markets, private property**
- **Forced collectivization and communal dining**
- **Targeting of intellectuals, religious practitioners, urban residents**
- **Zone system of administrative control** (six zones, each with own leadership)

The party called itself "Angkar" (អង្គការ—"The Organization"). Its directives were absolute. Possession of glasses, speaking French, or having soft hands could mean death as evidence of intellectual status.

**Key Figure Profile:**

**Pol Pot (Saloth Sar)** — Brother Number One
- Born 1925 to prosperous farming family
- Studied in Paris; joined French Communist Party
- Led Khmer Rouge from 1963
- Supreme leader of Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979)
- "I came to carry out the struggle, not to kill people" (1997 interview)
- Died under house arrest (1998) before facing tribunal
- Photograph: Rarely photographed; 1970s propaganda image available

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: None**

**Parallax Treatment:**
- Background: Destroyed currency montage (Layer 0)
- Subject: Collectivization photographs (Layer 2)
- Overlay: Angkar slogans with translation (Layer 3)

### Chapter 5: Starvation as Policy
*1976–1978*

**Metaphor:** The regime that governed through hunger

**Central Photographs:**
- Irrigation projects (forced labor)
- Rice fields and quotas
- Malnourished survivors (click-to-reveal)
- Documents showing agricultural quota demands

**Content Focus:**
Death toll breakdown (per scholarly estimates):
- **Execution:** ~500,000–1 million
- **Starvation:** ~500,000–1 million
- **Disease and overwork:** ~500,000

The Khmer Rouge exported rice while its people starved. Agricultural quotas were impossible to meet; failure to meet them was evidence of sabotage, punishable by death. Medicine was banned as bourgeois; traditional remedies were mandated. Malaria, dysentery, and cholera swept through cooperatives.

This chapter addresses the common misconception that the Khmer Rouge deaths were "just a famine." They were policy-driven starvation.

**Key Figure Profile:**

**Khieu Samphan** — The Economist of Revolution
- Head of State of Democratic Kampuchea
- Doctorate in economics from Paris
- Presented regime as agrarian reform
- Convicted of genocide (ethnic Vietnamese) and crimes against humanity (2018)
- Life sentence; still serving as of this writing
- Photograph: ECCC courtroom photos (33 files, CC BY-SA)

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: None**

**Parallax Treatment:**
- Background: Rice stalks, golden (Layer 0)
- Mid-ground: Quota documents (Layer 1)
- Subject: Labor photography (Layer 2)
- Overlay: Death toll sources, ranges (Layer 3)

### Chapter 6: S-21 — Bureaucracy of Terror
*1976–1979*

**Metaphor:** A school turned slaughterhouse

**Central Photographs:**
- Tuol Sleng (S-21) facade exterior
- Barbed wire nets (no human remains)
- Prisoner regulation boards
- Choeung Ek memorial stupa exterior

**⚠️ Click-to-Reveal Content:**
- Victim photograph wall
- Interior interrogation rooms
- Mass grave sites

**Content Focus:**
S-21, codenamed for "Security Office 21," was a former high school converted into the regime's primary interrogation and extermination center. Between 14,000 and 17,000 people were detained here. Approximately 12 are known to have survived.

The facility was run by Duch (Kaing Guek Eav), a former mathematics teacher. Prisoners were photographed on intake, tortured into confessions of imaginary crimes, and transported to Choeung Ek—the "Killing Fields"—for execution.

S-21 was part of a network of 189-196 interrogation centers across the country. Its meticulous documentation—photographs, confessions, execution records—would later provide crucial evidence for the ECCC.

**Key Figure Profile:**

**Duch (Kaing Guek Eav)** — The Schoolteacher Who Ran S-21
- Former mathematics teacher
- Commander of S-21 (1975–1979)
- Oversaw detention and execution of ~14,000-17,000 people
- Converted to Christianity before trial
- "I am morally and legally responsible for the crimes committed at S-21"
- Convicted in Case 001 (2010); life sentence
- Died in detention (2020)
- Photograph: ECCC courtroom, 2009 (CC BY-SA)

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: "The Registry"**

Minimal scroll-lock (one of 2 permitted): Scroll reveals intake photograph count rising from 0 to ~14,000, each number representing a life.

- **0-25% scroll:** Single intake photograph appears (anonymized/respectful)
- **25-50% scroll:** Grid begins to populate with silhouettes
- **50-75% scroll:** Counter rises; grid fills
- **75-100% scroll:** Counter reaches ~14,000; text: "Approximately 12 survived"

**Skip affordance:** "Skip ↓" visible throughout

**Parallax Treatment:**
- Background: Document texture (Layer 0)
- Subject: Tuol Sleng exterior (Layer 2)
- Overlay: Citation: USHMM, ECCC Case 001 (Layer 3)

### Chapter 7: What Is Genocide?
*Legal Framework*

**Metaphor:** The word that names the crime

**Central Photographs:**
- UN Genocide Convention (1948) document
- ECCC courtroom during verdict
- Raphael Lemkin photograph (if available, PD)

**Content Focus:**
The 1948 UN Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts committed "with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group." This specific intent—*dolus specialis*—distinguishes genocide from other mass atrocities.

**ECCC Genocide Convictions:**
- **Nuon Chea:** Guilty of genocide against ethnic Vietnamese AND Cham Muslims
- **Khieu Samphan:** Guilty of genocide against ethnic Vietnamese

**Key Distinction:** The Khmer Rouge committed both:
- **Genocide** (against specific protected groups: Vietnamese, Cham)
- **Crimes against humanity** (against broader Cambodian population)

The legal category matters because it shapes how we understand, remember, and respond to mass atrocity.

**Key Figure Profile:**

**Nuon Chea** — Brother Number Two
- Deputy Secretary of Communist Party of Kampuchea
- Chief ideologist of the Khmer Rouge
- "I accept moral responsibility for the suffering of the Cambodian people"
- Convicted of genocide (ethnic Vietnamese and Cham) and crimes against humanity (2018)
- Life sentence
- Died in hospital (2019)
- Photograph: ECCC courtroom (36 files, CC BY-SA)

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: None**

**Parallax Treatment:**
- Background: UN document texture (Layer 0)
- Subject: ECCC courtroom photographs (Layer 2)
- Overlay: Definition text, verdict quotes (Layer 3)

### Chapter 8: The World Outside
*1975–1979*

**Metaphor:** The silence that shielded slaughter

**Central Photographs:**
- UN General Assembly chamber
- Empty embassies in Phnom Penh
- Border refugee imagery
- International newspaper headlines (if available)

**Content Focus:**
What did the world know? What did the world do?

- **Refugees reported atrocities** from 1975 onward
- **Some Western journalists** (Elizabeth Becker, 1978) visited and reported
- **Cambodia's UN seat** remained contested; Khmer Rouge kept it until 1982
- **Cold War calculations** prioritized anti-Vietnamese alliance

The international community failed Cambodia. This chapter addresses the misconception that "the world didn't know"—evidence existed; the world chose not to act.

**Key Figure Profile:**

**Elizabeth Becker** — The Witness
- American journalist; one of two Western journalists to interview Pol Pot in power (December 1978)
- Author of *When the War Was Over*
- Her audio recordings used as ECCC evidence
- Photograph: If available; otherwise, book cover

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: None**

**Parallax Treatment:**
- Background: Newspaper texture (Layer 0)
- Subject: UN photographs (Layer 2)
- Overlay: Timeline of what was known, when (Layer 3)

### Chapter 9: After 1979
*January 1979 – 1990s*

**Metaphor:** When liberation brings new suffering

**Central Photographs:**
- Vietnamese forces entering Phnom Penh (January 7, 1979)
- Refugee camps on Thai border
- Landmine victim imagery (respectful, click-to-reveal)
- Paris Peace Accords signing (1991)

**Content Focus:**
On January 7, 1979, Vietnamese forces captured Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge fled to the countryside, where they continued armed resistance for nearly two more decades.

What followed was not peace:
- **Vietnamese occupation** (1979–1989)
- **Refugee crisis** (300,000+ in Thai border camps)
- **Landmine contamination** (one of the world's most mined countries)
- **Continued international recognition of Khmer Rouge** at UN

The Paris Peace Accords (1991) and UNTAC mission (1992–1993) eventually brought elections—but many perpetrators never faced justice.

**Key Figure Profile:**

**Hun Sen** — The Survivor Who Ruled
- Former Khmer Rouge cadre who defected (1977)
- Prime Minister of Cambodia (1985–2023)
- Oversaw ECCC establishment
- Criticized for limiting tribunal scope
- Complex legacy: stability, authoritarianism, compromised justice
- Photograph: Official government portraits, Wikimedia Commons

### Chapter 10: Justice & Memory
*1997–2022*

**Metaphor:** The trial that tried to heal a nation

**Central Photographs:**
- ECCC courtroom (129 files on Wikimedia Commons)
- Convicted defendants (Duch, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan)
- DC-Cam archives
- Tuol Sleng Museum today

**Content Focus:**
The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) was a hybrid tribunal—Cambodian and international judges—established to try senior Khmer Rouge leaders.

**ECCC Outcomes:**
| Case | Defendant | Verdict | Sentence |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 001 | Duch | Guilty | Life imprisonment |
| 002/01 | Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan | Guilty (crimes against humanity) | Life imprisonment |
| 002/02 | Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan | Guilty (genocide) | Life imprisonment affirmed |

**Only 3 convictions** after 16 years and $337 million.

Many perpetrators died before trial (Pol Pot, 1998; Ieng Sary, 2013; Nuon Chea, 2019). The tribunal entered residual functions in 2022.

**DC-Cam Education:**
- 5,000+ teachers trained since 2009
- 1 million students learning DK history (grades 9-12)
- 7 million+ young Cambodians reached overall
- Mandatory curriculum since 2009

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: "The Verdict"**

Second permitted scroll-lock: Timeline assembles showing case progression from 2006 to 2022.

- **0-30% scroll:** ECCC established (2006)
- **30-50% scroll:** Case 001 verdict (2010)
- **50-70% scroll:** Case 002/01, 002/02 verdicts (2014, 2018)
- **70-90% scroll:** Appeals, deaths, final judgment (2022)

### Chapter 11: The Education Gap
*Global Context*

**Metaphor:** The genocide that isn't taught

**Central Photographs:**
- World map of genocide education curricula
- Comparative textbook imagery
- Cambodian classroom with DK history materials

**Content Focus:**
In Western schools, genocide education is Holocaust-centric. Cambodia—where a quarter of the population died—receives minimal coverage. Why?

Possible factors:
- **Geographic and cultural distance** from Western centers
- **Cold War complicity** (US bombing, Khmer Rouge UN seat)
- **Lack of translated survivor testimony** until recently
- **Assumption that "Asian" histories are separate**

Cambodia has built its own education: DC-Cam's teacher training, mandatory curriculum, memorial sites. But global awareness lags.

This chapter does not claim equivalence between genocides; it asks why some are remembered while others are forgotten.

- Subject: Comparative education data (Layer 2)
- Overlay: Citations to DC-Cam education statistics (Layer 3)

### Chapter 12: Epilogue — What Survives
*Present Day*

**Metaphor:** Memory as resistance to erasure

**Central Photographs:**
- Choeung Ek stupa today (memorial visitors)
- Tuol Sleng Museum visitors
- Cambodian youth at memorial sites
- Surviving traditional arts (dance, music)

**Content Focus:**
Year Zero attempted to erase history. It failed.

Today, 81 genocide memorials dot Cambodia. The stupa at Choeung Ek contains the skulls of victims—a memorial and a warning. Tuol Sleng receives thousands of visitors annually. Cambodian artists, writers, and filmmakers continue to process inherited trauma.

The generation born after 1979 now outnumbers survivors. Memory depends on education, documentation, and the courage to remember what power would have erased.

**Key Figure Profile:**

**Youk Chhang** — The Documentarian
- Executive Director, Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam)
- Survivor of Democratic Kampuchea
- Built archive of 1.7+ million document pages
- Trained 5,000+ teachers in genocide education
- "Without memory, there is no justice"
- Photograph: DC-Cam press materials

**Scroll-Lock Sequence: None**

**Final Element:**
Essay concludes with scrolling list of memorial sites and invitation to learn more. Full bibliography accessible. Glossary of 50 terms available.

- **Headlines:** Playfair Display (weight 600) — Dignified, serif, historical gravitas
- **Body:** Source Sans Pro — Highly readable, neutral, professional
- **Khmer Script:** Noto Sans Khmer — For terms, names, quotes in original script
- **Quotes:** Playfair Display Italic — Distinctive, attributed testimony
- **Technical/Citations:** JetBrains Mono — Case numbers, dates, legal references
- **Captions/Data:** Source Sans Pro (weight 300) — Light, unobtrusive

### Animation Principles

- **Scroll-lock zone depth:** 800-1200px maximum
- **Photo transitions:** 600ms ease-out
- **Text reveals:** 400ms stagger (50ms between lines)
- **Parallax ratios:** Background 0.3x, Mid 0.7x, Subject 1.0x, Ambient 0.2x
- **Easing curve:** `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)` (ease-out-quad)
- **Reduced motion:** All animations become instant; scroll-locks become reveals

## Layer 6: Implementation

### Responsive Considerations

**Mobile Adaptations:**
- Parallax disabled below 768px (performance)
- Scroll-lock sequences become swipe galleries
- Progress bar moves to bottom horizontal strip
- Typography scales: Headlines 1.5rem → 1.25rem, Body 1rem → 0.9375rem
- Click-to-reveal becomes tap-to-reveal with clear indicator

**Tablet:**
- Parallax at reduced intensity (0.5x maximum)
- Two-column layout where appropriate
- Touch-friendly skip buttons (minimum 44px tap target)

### Accessibility Requirements

- **Skip affordances:** Every scroll-lock has visible, keyboard-accessible skip button
- **Reduced motion:** `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all parallax and animations
- **Screen reader:** Full alt text for all images; ARIA labels for interactive elements
- **Color contrast:** WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 for body text)
- **Focus indicators:** Visible focus rings on all interactive elements
- **Heading hierarchy:** Proper semantic structure (h1 → h2 → h3)
- **Content warnings:** Announced to screen readers before distressing content

### Source Attribution Requirements

Every photograph, quote, and statistic must be attributed inline or in dedicated citation block.

**Citation Format:**
```
[Content] — Source: [Archive/Author], [Date], [License]
```
