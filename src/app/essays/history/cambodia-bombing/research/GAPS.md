# Research Gaps and Limitations

## What Cannot Be Claimed with Confidence

### 1. Precise Tonnage Figure

**The Problem:** Estimates range from ~500,000 to 2.7 million tons.

**What We Know:**
- ~500,000 tons is the corrected scholarly consensus (Kiernan 1989, Kiernan/Owen 2015)
- 2.7 million ton figure (Owen/Kiernan 2006) was retracted due to database errors

**What We Cannot Claim:**
- ~~"2.7 million tons"~~ — Use "approximately 500,000 tons"
- ~~"Most heavily bombed country in history"~~ — Laos and South Vietnam received more
- ~~"More than all of WWII combined"~~ — Only valid with the erroneous figure

**Recommended Language:**
> "Approximately 500,000 tons of U.S. bombs fell on Cambodia between 1969 and 1973, more than all bombs dropped on Japan in World War II."

### 2. Precise Civilian Death Toll

**The Problem:** Estimates vary wildly.

**Available Estimates:**
- 50,000-150,000 (Kiernan's widely-cited range)
- 50,000 (Kissinger's own cited memo)
- Higher figures remain unverifiable

**Why Precision Is Impossible:**
- B-52 carpet bombing often vaporized victims
- No mass graves to excavate (unlike Khmer Rouge killings)
- Displacement deaths uncounted
- Many rural areas had no census data

**Recommended Language:**
> "Scholarly estimates of civilian deaths range from 50,000 to 150,000, though precise figures are impossible to establish."

### 3. Direct Causal Link: Bombing → Khmer Rouge Victory

**The Problem:** Correlation vs. causation debate continues among historians.

**What Evidence Supports:**
- CIA report: Khmer Rouge used bombing as "main theme of propaganda"
- GAO report: 60% of refugees cited bombing as reason for displacement
- Khmer Rouge growth: ~1,000 (1969) to 220,000 (1973)
- Survivor testimony of joining resistance after raids

**What Historians Debate:**
- Relative weight of bombing vs. other factors:
  - Sihanouk's overthrow and subsequent endorsement of KR
  - North Vietnamese presence and support
  - Pre-existing communist organization
  - Economic disruption from civil war

**Recommended Language:**
> "Historians debate the relative weight of U.S. bombing among factors enabling Khmer Rouge recruitment, though evidence suggests it was a significant contributor."

### 4. Nixon/Kissinger's Knowledge of Civilian Casualties

**The Problem:** Documentary record is incomplete.

**What Documents Show:**
- Abrams claimed areas were "underpopulated"
- Other generals knew "some Cambodian casualties would be sustained"
- "Anything that flies on anything that moves" order documented

**What Remains Unclear:**
- Did Nixon/Kissinger receive accurate casualty estimates?
- Were civilian casualties deliberately downplayed in briefings?
- What did they know and when?

**Recommended Language:**
> "Declassified documents show awareness that casualties would occur, though the extent of leadership knowledge about civilian deaths remains unclear."

---

### 5. Sihanouk's Foreknowledge of Bombing

**The Problem:** His position is ambiguous.

**What's Known:**
- He tacitly permitted Vietnamese communist sanctuaries
- He tacitly permitted Sihanouk Trail supply route
- He made no public protest when bombing was leaked (May 1969)

**What's Debated:**
- Was his silence tacit permission?
- Did he have private communications with U.S.?
- Did he calculate bombing would weaken Vietnamese presence?

### 6. Complete Sortie-Level Accuracy of Yale CGEO Database

**The Problem:** Database has known limitations.

**What's Reliable:**
- Overall patterns and geographic distribution
- Relative intensity by region and time period
- Number of sorties (230,516 total)

**What May Be Less Accurate:**
- Individual sortie tonnage (the "Load Weight" digit error)
- Some border-area coordinates
- Complete coverage of all missions

## Gaps in Available Primary Sources

### Documents Still Classified
- Some NSC files remain classified
- CIA operational intelligence not fully released
- Some AFHRA records require FOIA
- Communications with Sihanouk (if any)

### Documents Destroyed
- Many records burned in "special furnace" per Abrams testimony
- False reports destroyed when true reports created
- Unknown extent of destruction

### Documents Never Created
- Cambodian government records from 1970-1975 (destroyed by KR)
- Oral histories of Cambodian civilian witnesses (limited collection)
- Medical records of bombing casualties

---

## Recommended Approach

### When In Doubt, Hedge
- Use "approximately" for figures
- Use "scholarly estimates suggest" for contested numbers
- Use "evidence indicates" rather than "proves"

### Cite The Uncertainty
- Note the tonnage controversy explicitly
- Acknowledge the casualty estimate range
- Be honest about what we don't know

### Let Documents Speak
- Use direct quotes where verified
- The "anything that flies" quote is verified
- Congressional testimony is on record

## Key Sources for Uncertainty Documentation

1. **Kiernan & Owen (2015)** — Acknowledge their own correction
2. **High et al. (2013)** — Database error analysis
3. **Shawcross (1979)** — Notes evidentiary gaps throughout
4. **FRUS volumes** — Show what was and wasn't documented
