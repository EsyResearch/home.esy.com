### Target Rationale: The Sanctuaries

**Primary Target:** Central Office for South Vietnam (COSVN) - the elusive PAVN/VC political and military headquarters believed located in the Fishhook region.

**Geographic Context:**
- **Fishhook:** Salient of Kampong Cham Province protruding into Binh Long and Tay Ninh provinces, approximately 80 km northwest of Saigon. Contained Base Areas 352 and 353.
- **Parrot's Beak:** Salient of Svay Rieng Province, approximately 65 km northwest of Saigon, only 33 miles from the capital.

**What was actually found:** The first Breakfast strike discovered "The City" - a vast logistics area covering 3 square km with 182 storage bunkers, 1,282 individual weapons, 202 crew-served weapons, 30 tons of rice, and large amounts of ammunition. COSVN itself was never captured - it was a dispersed, highly-mobile headquarters network.

## 2. OPERATION FREEDOM DEAL (May 19, 1970 - August 15, 1973)

### Mission Statement and Evolution

**Initial Purpose:** Air support and interdiction to disrupt PAVN/NLF supply networks following the Cambodian incursion.

**Key Dates:**
| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| April 29 - July 22, 1970 | ARVN ground operations in Cambodia |
| May 1 - June 30, 1970 | U.S. ground forces in Cambodia |
| May 19, 1970 | Operation Freedom Deal begins |
| May 30, 1970 | First Freedom Deal sorties: 24 fighter sorties strike 6 targets |
| June 6, 1970 | Operation formally named "Freedom Deal" |
| June 30, 1970 | Nixon's deadline; all U.S. ground forces withdraw |
| January 28, 1973 | Lon Nol ceasefire; U.S. bombing halted |
| February 9, 1973 | Bombing resumes after Khmer Rouge refuses ceasefire |
| August 15, 1973 | Final mission; bombing ends per Congressional mandate |

### Geographic Constraints and Expansion

| Period | Boundary | Depth |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Initial (May 1970) | East of Mekong River | 48 km from South Vietnam border |
| Within 2 months | Extended past Mekong | Direct support of Cambodian forces |
| By early 1971 | Route 7 to Laotian border (north); 120 km beyond Mekong (west) | Full coverage |

**Falsified Reports (July 1970 - February 1971):** Approximately 40% of the 8,000+ sorties were flown outside the authorized boundary. Kissinger, Haig, and Colonel Ray Sitton developed a policy of falsifying mission reports.

| Period | Sorties | Tonnage | Character |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| 1965-1968 | 2,565 | 214 tons | Tactical strikes, spillover from Vietnam operations |

### Tonnage by Period

| Period | Tonnage | Source |

| 1965-1968 | 214 tons | Yale GSP |
| Operation Menu | 108,000-110,000 tons | Multiple |
| Operation Freedom Deal (total) | ~430,000 tons | Calculated |
| 1973 alone | 250,000 tons | Wikipedia |
| **Total** | **~500,000 tons** (corrected consensus) | Multiple |

**Note:** Owen and Kiernan initially claimed 2,756,941 tons based on the Clinton declassified database, but later retracted this figure due to database errors. The corrected estimate is "at least 500,000 tons, possibly far more."

## 5. THE SIHANOUK TRAIL

**Significance:** The Sihanouk Trail was a parallel logistics system to the Ho Chi Minh Trail, running through Cambodia.

**Scale:** Between December 1966 and April 1970, over 21,000 tons of ordnance shipped through Sihanoukville. Road capacity up to 1,200 tons daily.

**End:** The trail was severed following the March 18, 1970 coup that installed Lon Nol.
