# RESEARCH NOTES: Secrecy and Political Dimensions of Cambodia Bombing

## 1. SECRECY ARCHITECTURE

### The Dual Reporting System

**Origin and Design:**
- Shortly after Nixon's inauguration, on February 24, 1969, Kissinger and his military aide Alexander Haig held meetings with Colonel Ray Sitton (known as "Mr. B-52" in the Pentagon) to develop a "dual reporting system" - a method to bomb Cambodia secretly while accounting for fuel, spare parts, and munitions.
- The system was finalized during a Brussels meeting (late February 1969) between Nixon, Haig, and Colonel Sitton.

**How It Worked:**
- All communications split along two paths: one overt (ordering typical B-52 missions in South Vietnam near the Cambodian border), one covert (back-channel messages ordering classified strikes).
- Colonel Sitton would bring target lists to the White House. Kissinger would direct: "Strike here, strike there."
- Sitton would then backchannel coordinates to Saigon, circumventing the military chain of command.
- A courier delivered bombing orders in sealed, unmarked manila envelopes to radar stations each afternoon.
- At the last minute, officers switched B-52 flight paths from South Vietnam to Cambodian targets.
- After each strike, all authentic documents were burned. A "special furnace" operated "probably 12 hours a day" according to General Abrams' later congressional testimony.
- False post-strike reports with fabricated South Vietnamese coordinates were created.
- Mission completion was reported via code: "The ball game is over."

### Who Knew vs. Who Was Kept in Dark

**Those With Full Knowledge (approximately 6 civilians):**
- President Richard Nixon
- National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger
- Colonel Alexander Haig (Kissinger's military aide)
- Colonel Ray Sitton (JCS B-52 expert)
- Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird (briefed but opposed secrecy)
- General Creighton Abrams (MACV Commander)
- General Earle Wheeler (Chairman, Joint Chiefs)

**Those Kept in the Dark:**
- Congress (including Armed Services Committees)
- Secretary of State William P. Rogers (initially)
- Most Pentagon officials
- The American public
- Air Force logistics and personnel administrators (received false data)

## 2. THE BEECHER LEAK (May 1969)

### The Article

**Date:** May 9, 1969
**Publication:** The New York Times, front page (lower right corner)
**Author:** William M. Beecher, military correspondent
**Headline:** "Raids in Cambodia by U.S. Unprotested"

**Content:** The article accurately described the secret B-52 bombing raids in Cambodia, noting that in the previous two weeks alone, some 5,000 tons of ordnance had been dropped on Cambodia.

### Kissinger's Reaction

**Immediate Response:**
Kissinger called FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover from Key Biscayne, Florida and stated:
> "The story is extraordinarily damaging and uses secret information... Put whatever resources I need to find who did this... Do it discreetly, of course, but they would like to know where it came from because it is very damaging and potentially very dangerous."

Hoover later claimed Kissinger told him:
> "We will destroy whoever did this."

**The Wiretap Program:**
- Morton Halperin, NSC staffer (and Beecher's former college roommate), became the main suspect.
- May 9, 1969: FBI wiretap initiated on Halperin's residence telephone.
- Halperin's phone was illegally tapped for 21 months.
- 13 NSC staffers and 4 journalists were eventually wiretapped without warrants.

## 3. CONGRESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE TIMELINE

### What Congress Knew and When

- Congress was deliberately kept uninformed about Operation Menu.
- The dual reporting system ensured Congressional oversight committees received falsified data.

**1973: The Revelation**
- December 1972: Major Hal Knight writes to Senator William Proxmire about falsified bombing reports.
- July 16, 1973: Major Knight testifies before Senate Armed Services Committee.
- July 16, 1973: Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger acknowledges that B-52s secretly bombed Cambodia in 1969-1970.
