# The Cambodia Bombing Tonnage Controversy: A Critical Analysis

## Executive Summary

The tonnage of U.S. bombs dropped on Cambodia is one of the most contentious data disputes in modern history. Estimates have varied dramatically, from approximately 500,000 tons to 2.7 million tons.

**Bottom Line**: The ~500,000 tons figure (specifically 539,129 tons for 1969-1973) remains the most defensible estimate. The 2.7 million ton figure, while widely cited, resulted from a data entry error that its original authors have publicly corrected.

## Timeline of Tonnage Estimates

### 1989: Original Scholarly Estimate (~539,000 tons)
**Source**: Ben Kiernan, "The American Bombardment of Kampuchea, 1969-1973," *Vietnam Generation*, Vol. 1, No. 1 (Winter 1989)
- **Figure**: 539,129 tons for 1969-1973
- **Status**: This figure has proven durable and is now considered reliable

### 2006-2007: The 2.7 Million Ton Claim
**Source**: Taylor Owen and Ben Kiernan, "Bombs Over Cambodia," *The Walrus* (October 2006)
- **Claim**: 2,756,941 tons dropped in 230,516 sorties on 113,716 sites
- **Impact**: Became the "new normal" in Cambodian studies

### 2010-2015: THE CORRECTION
**Source**: Ben Kiernan and Taylor Owen, "Making More Enemies than We Kill?" *The Asia-Pacific Journal* (April 27, 2015)

**Correction Text**: "This tonnage data may be incorrect. In new work using the original Air Force SEADAB and CACTA databases, Holly High and others have re-analyzed the total Cambodia tonnage figures and argue that the total tonnage dropped on Cambodia was at least 472,313 tons, or somewhat higher."

**Current consensus**: "It remains undisputed that in 1969-73 alone, around 500,000 tons of U.S. bombs fell on Cambodia"

## The Database Errors Explained

### The Pentagon's Four Databases

| Database | Full Name | Period Covered |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **CACTA** | Combat Activities File | Oct 1965 - Dec 1970 |
| **SEADAB** | Southeast Asia Database | Jan 1970 - Jun 1975 |
| **SACCOACT** | SAC Combat Activities | Jun 1965 - Aug 1973 |
| **HERBS** | Herbicide Files | Jul 1965 - Feb 1971 |

### The "Load Weight" Digit Error

**Discovery by Holly High (University of Sydney)**:

For SEADAB: "Its 'Load weight' column represents the total of all bombs for number of aircraft... The only hitch was that **all figures ended in zero!!!** A very unlikely scenario. We did some checking and deduced that somehow, **the entire field had been multiplied by ten**."

**The Fix**: All SEADAB "Load Weight" figures had to be **divided by ten** to get accurate totals.

## WWII Comparison Problem

### The Claim That No Longer Holds
"Cambodia received more bombs than the Allies dropped on Germany in WWII" was based on 2.7 million tons. **This comparison is invalid** at ~500,000 tons.

### Actual WWII Tonnage
| Target | Tonnage |
|--------|---------|
| All European Theater | ~2.7 million tons |
| Germany specifically | ~1.4 million tons |
| Japan (home islands) | ~160,000 tons |

### Indochina Breakdown
| Country | Tonnage |
|---------|---------|
| South Vietnam | ~4 million tons |
| Laos | ~2 million tons |
| North Vietnam | ~1 million tons |
| Cambodia | ~500,000 tons |
| **TOTAL** | ~6-7.5 million tons |

### Valid Comparisons
- Indochina received more bombs than all of WWII combined (TRUE)
- Cambodia received more bombs than Japan's home islands (TRUE)
- Laos received more bombs than Germany (TRUE)
- Cambodia was "the most heavily bombed country in history" (FALSE - Laos and South Vietnam received more)

## What IS Known with Certainty

### The Pattern of Bombing Is Clear
- 115,273 sites targeted in 231,467 sorties (Yale GSP database)
- "Nearly every square mile" of eastern Cambodia was hit
- Final phase (Feb-Aug 1973) focused on populated areas around Phnom Penh

### The Intent Is Documented
Nixon to Kissinger (December 1970):
> "I want them to hit everything. I want them to use the big planes, the small planes, everything they can..."

Kissinger relaying Nixon's order:
> **"A massive bombing campaign in Cambodia. Anything that flies on anything that moves."**

### 500,000 tons means:
- More than all bombs dropped on Japan in WWII
- Equivalent to ~25 Hiroshima-sized explosions (by TNT equivalent)
- 257,000 tons in 1973 alone
- 82,000 tons in final 45 days

## Guidance for Responsible Citation

### What You CAN Claim (with confidence)
1. "The U.S. dropped approximately 500,000 tons of bombs on Cambodia between 1969 and 1973."
2. "The bombing was among the most intensive aerial campaigns in history."
3. "Declassified transcripts reveal Nixon ordered strikes on 'anything that moves.'"

### What You Should QUALIFY
1. "Earlier estimates of 2.7 million tons have been revised to approximately 500,000 tons due to database errors."

### What You Should AVOID
- ~~"Cambodia received more bombs than all of WWII"~~ (based on erroneous 2.7M figure)
- ~~"Cambodia was the most heavily bombed country in history"~~ (Laos and South Vietnam received more)
