# Contemporary Impact: The Ongoing Legacy of U.S. Bombing in Cambodia

## 1. UXO Contamination Today

### Current Status (January 2024)
| Type | Area (km²) | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Total contaminated** | ~1,856 km² | Combined mine and UXO |
| Minefields | 652 km² | Anti-personnel and anti-tank mines |
| UXO/Cluster munition fields | 1,204 km² | Bombs, submunitions, other ERW |
| Population at risk | ~1 million people | Living in contaminated areas |

### Why Contamination Persists
- Scale of bombing with 10-30% failure rates for certain munitions
- Cluster munitions: Hundreds of thousands of submunitions scattered
- Softer, more fertile soil absorbed bombs without detonation
- At current clearance rates, decades of work remain

### Types of Ordnance Remaining
- **Aerial bombs**: Including 500-lb and 750-lb general purpose bombs
- **Cluster munitions**: BLU-26, BLU-42 submunitions ("bombies")
- **Landmines**: Legacy of civil war (1970s-1998), primarily in northwestern provinces

### Most Affected Provinces
- **Northwestern border** (Thailand): Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Oddar Meanchey, Pailin
- **Northern provinces**: Preah Vihear, Kampong Thom
- **Eastern provinces** (Vietnam border): Ratanakiri

## 2. Casualty Data

### Historical Toll
| Period | Casualties | Context |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Since 1979 (total)** | **65,000+** | Deaths and injuries combined |
| Deaths | ~20,000 | Since 1979 |
| Amputees | 40,000+ | One of highest rates globally |

### Annual Casualty Trends
| Year | Casualties |
|------|------------|
| 1996 | 4,320 (peak) |
| 2010 | 286 |
| 2020 | 65 |
| 2023 | 30-32 |
| 2024 | 49 |

**Key Finding:** 99% reduction from peak (4,320 in 1996 to 49 in 2024), but incidents continue. Children and farmers remain most vulnerable.

## 3. Clearance Organizations

### CMAC (Cambodian Mine Action Centre)
- Established 1992; national lead organization
- Destroyed: 596,168 mines + 2,537,335 ERW items
- Released: 1,616+ km² since 1992

### HALO Trust
- First demining org in Cambodia (1991)
- 1,200+ staff (50% women)
- Cleared 5,000+ minefields, 511+ km²

### MAG (Mines Advisory Group)
- Operating since October 1992; ~500 staff
- Only international org in both eastern and western Cambodia

### APOPO
- Operating since 2015; uses African Giant Pouched Rats
- A single rat can search tennis-court area in 20 min vs. 4 days for human deminer

### Combined Progress
- 3,000+ km² cleared since 1992
- 4+ million landmines and UXOs destroyed

## 4. Human Impact

### Agricultural Limitations
- 102,778 families with restricted agricultural land access
- 46% of villages nationwide affected by explosive ordnance
- Farmers avoid fertile soil (softer = more unexploded bombs)

### Health Effects
**Psychological:**
- 28.4% PTSD prevalence in community studies
- 87% of Khmer Rouge survivors still experience disturbing memories
- Cultural idiom "Baksbat" (broken courage): lack of trust, submissiveness, fearfulness

**Intergenerational Trauma:**
- Parents' PTSD predicts children's anxiety
- Trauma began with bombing, before Khmer Rouge era

## 5. Displacement Patterns (1970-1975)

### Rural to Urban Migration
| Metric | Figure |
|--------|--------|
| Displaced persons | **2+ million** (25%+ of population) |
| Phnom Penh population (1970) | ~600,000 |
| Phnom Penh population (1975) | **2+ million** |

By April 1975, **half of Phnom Penh's population were refugees** who had fled rural areas due to U.S. bombing.

### Connection to Khmer Rouge Recruitment

**Ben Kiernan's thesis:**
> "The Khmer Rouge would not have won power without U.S. economic and military destabilization of Cambodia."

**Evidence:**
- CIA (May 1973): KR using damage as "main theme of their propaganda"
- U.S. GAO (1971): 60% of refugees cited bombing as reason for displacement
- Khmer Rouge grew from ~1,000 (1969) to 220,000 (1973)

## 6. Memory and Commemoration

### The Absence of Bombing Memorials
A striking feature: **near-total absence of official memorials** specifically for U.S. bombing victims.

**Existing memorials focus on Khmer Rouge era:**
- Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (S-21) - UNESCO World Heritage 2025
- Choeung Ek "Killing Fields"

**Memory Gap:** Vietnam War memorial lists 58,215 American dead; Cambodian bombing deaths (50,000-150,000) lack comparable recognition in either country.

## 7. SDG 18: Cambodia's Unique Goal

Cambodia added an 18th SDG: "End the negative impact of mines/ERW and promote victim assistance."

**Revised goal:** Mine-free Cambodia by **2030** (originally 2025)

**Progress:**
- 15 provinces declared mine-free
- 10 provinces still require clearance
- Casualties reduced from 4,320 (1996) to 49 (2024)

---

## 8. Key Statistics Summary

### The Bombing
- **~500,000 tons** of bombs dropped (1969-1973)
- **230,516** sorties flown
- **50,000-150,000** civilians killed (estimates vary)
- **2+ million** displaced

### The Legacy
- **65,000+** killed or injured by mines/ERW since 1979
- **40,000+** amputees
- **1,856 km²** still contaminated (2024)
- **~1 million** people at risk

### The Response
- **596,168** mines destroyed by CMAC alone
- **3,000+ km²** cleared since 1992
- **99%** reduction in annual casualties (1996-2024)
