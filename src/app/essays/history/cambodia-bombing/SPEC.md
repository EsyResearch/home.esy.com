# LAYER 1: STRATEGIC FOUNDATION

## Project Title

**CAMBODIA BOMBED (1965–1973)**
*The Air War You Weren't Meant to See — Visualized*

## Executive Brief

### Emotional Throughline
From secret to exposed. From classified to contested. From forgotten to still unfinished. This essay traces the arc of the most intensive aerial bombardment in history that was hidden from the American public, leaked to a skeptical press, denied by its architects, debated by historians, partially declassified, and still reverberates in Cambodian soil today.

### Stakes
- 500,000 tons of bombs dropped on a neutral nation
- Estimated 50,000-150,000 civilians killed
- 2+ million displaced
- A bombing campaign that fueled the rise of the Khmer Rouge
- 65,000+ casualties from unexploded ordnance since 1979
- 1,856 km² still contaminated today

### Transformation Promise
The reader begins knowing "the US bombed Cambodia during Vietnam." They leave understanding *how* secrecy was engineered, *why* it remained hidden, *who* revealed it, *what* the data actually shows (and doesn't), and *why it still matters* as deminers clear unexploded bombs today.

### Voice
Documentary. Forensic. Archival. Let documents speak. The horror is in the precision of the bureaucratic record—the code names, the tonnage, the coordinates, the lies. No purple prose required when you have "anything that flies on anything that moves" in the historical record.

## Visual Treatment Philosophy

### Medium: Photorealistic
- **Primary sources**: Archival photography, declassified documents, congressional testimony photos, satellite imagery
- **Era treatments**:
  - 1960s-1970s: B&W or period color grading with grain
  - Contemporary: Clean, sharp color for UXO/clearance footage
- **NO illustrations mixed with photography**
- **Parallax achieved through**: Photo masking, depth separation, document layering

### Documentary Aesthetic
- Declassified stamps and redaction marks as visual motifs
- Teletype/typewriter typography for quotes from period documents
- Map overlays with bombing coordinates
- Before/after sliders for crater landscapes

# LAYER 2: TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

## Scroll Behavior

### NO Scroll-Lock on Hero
The hero section is cinematic but **scrolls normally**. This essay earns attention through content, not captivity. The reader can always leave—but won't want to.

### Scroll-Lock Sequences (Interior)
Limited, purposeful scroll-locks at key dramatic moments:
1. **"The Ball Game Is Over"** — First strike visualization (Chapter 2)
2. **"Anything That Flies"** — The December 1970 order (Chapter 5)
3. **"The Furnace"** — Document destruction reveal (Chapter 6)
4. **"Still Unfinished"** — Contemporary UXO map (Chapter 10)

### Parallax Depth System

| Layer | Speed | Content |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Background | 0.3x | Satellite imagery, terrain maps |
| Mid-ground | 0.6x | Archival photos, document scans |
| Subject | 1.0x | Key figures, quotes, primary content |
| Overlay | 1.2x | Declassified stamps, coordinates, data |
| Ambient | 0.1x | Grain texture, atmospheric effects |

## Themed Progress Indicator

### Concept: Classification Status
A progress bar that transforms through the essay's arc:

```
[CLASSIFIED] → [LEAKED] → [DENIED] → [DEBATED] → [DECLASSIFIED] → [STILL UNFINISHED]
```

### Visual Treatment
- Starts with black redaction bar covering text
- Redaction gradually lifts as reader progresses
- Final state shows text with archival stamps and date markers
- Small indicator shows current "status" in the declassification arc

### Implementation
- 0-15%: "CLASSIFIED" — Black bar, document texture
- 15-30%: "LEAKED" — Bar cracking, light seeping through
- 30-45%: "DENIED" — Official seals, contradictory statements
- 45-65%: "DEBATED" — Congressional imagery, split screens
- 65-85%: "DECLASSIFIED" — Bar lifted, documents revealed
- 85-100%: "STILL UNFINISHED" — Contemporary photography, UXO imagery
