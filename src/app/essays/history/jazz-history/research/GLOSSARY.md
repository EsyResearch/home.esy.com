## AABA (Song Form)

**Definition**: The most common structure for jazz standards and Tin Pan Alley songs, consisting of four eight-bar sections totaling 32 bars. The form follows a pattern where two identical A sections (the main melody) are followed by a contrasting B section (the bridge), then a return to the A section.

**Example**: "I Got Rhythm," "Over the Rainbow," and "Take the A Train" all follow this form.

## Arranging vs. Composing

**Definition**: Composing is the creation of original music from scratch, including melody, harmony, and rhythm. Arranging is the adaptation of existing music for specific performers or ensembles, which may involve reharmonization, changing instrumentation, altering tempo, or restructuring sections.

**Example**: Duke Ellington composed "Take the A Train," while various arrangers have adapted it for different big bands, small combos, and orchestras.

**Source**: Wyzant - Composition vs. Arranging

## Backbeat

**Definition**: A rhythmic emphasis on beats two and four in 4/4 time, typically played by the snare drum or hi-hat cymbal. This accenting pattern originated in African American musical traditions as a contrast to European music's emphasis on beats one and three.

**Example**: In jazz, the drummer often plays the backbeat on the closed hi-hat while swinging on the ride cymbal.

## Bandstand

**Definition**: The stage or platform where musicians perform. In jazz slang, "the stand" refers to the physical space of performance and, by extension, the act of performing live.

**Example**: "I learned more on the bandstand than I ever did in a classroom."

**Source**: Merriam-Webster

## Blue Note

**Definition**: A note sung or played at a slightly lower pitch than standard for expressive effect, typically affecting the third, fifth, or seventh scale degrees. Blue notes are fundamental to the distinctive sound of blues and jazz, creating emotional tension and soulfulness.

**Etymology**: The term emerged from African American musical traditions in the 19th century, blending West African scalar practices with European 12-tone systems.

**Source**: Britannica - Blue Note

## Bridge (Song Form)

**Definition**: The B section in an AABA song form, also called the "middle eight" or "channel." The bridge provides harmonic and melodic contrast to the A sections, typically occurring in the middle of the 32-bar form and lasting eight bars.

**Example**: In "I Got Rhythm," the bridge moves through a series of dominant seventh chords (the "Sears Roebuck bridge").

**Source**: Columbia Jazz Glossary

---

## Changes

**Definition**: The chord progression of a song, serving as the harmonic roadmap for improvisation. Musicians must know the changes to navigate a tune, as they define where the harmony moves throughout the piece.

**Example**: "Do you know the changes to 'All the Things You Are'?"

## Chart

**Definition**: A written musical arrangement, typically in the form of a lead sheet showing melody and chord symbols. Charts provide the essential information musicians need to perform a piece while leaving room for interpretation.

**Example**: A chart for a big band includes individual parts for each instrument, while a combo chart might be a single lead sheet.

---

## Chorus (Jazz Context)

**Definition**: One complete cycle through the chord progression of a song. Unlike in pop music where "chorus" refers to a repeated hook section, in jazz a chorus encompasses the entire form (whether 12, 16, or 32 bars), and soloists typically take multiple choruses during their improvisation.

**Example**: "She played three burning choruses on 'Giant Steps.'"

## Comping

**Definition**: Short for "accompanying" or "complementing," comping is the art of providing rhythmic and harmonic support for a soloist, typically performed by piano, guitar, or organ. Good comping involves responsive listening, tasteful chord voicings, and knowing when to play and when to stay silent.

**Etymology**: Likely derived from "accompaniment" or the verb "to complement."

## Cool (Aesthetic)

**Definition**: A jazz style and sensibility emerging in the late 1940s and 1950s, characterized by relaxed tempos, lighter tonal colors, restrained vibrato, and a more compositional approach than bebop. Cool jazz emphasized melody and arrangement over aggressive virtuosity.

**Example**: Miles Davis's "Birth of the Cool" sessions (1949-50) and the West Coast jazz movement epitomize this aesthetic.

## Cutting Contest (The Cut)

**Definition**: A competitive jam session where musicians attempt to outplay each other, demonstrating superior technique, creativity, and stamina. These musical battles were common at Harlem rent parties in the 1920s-40s and helped establish reputations.

**Etymology**: To "cut" another player originally meant to replace them at a gig by outperforming them.

**Source**: Wikipedia - Cutting Contest

---

## Fake Book

**Definition**: A collection of lead sheets providing basic musical information (melody, lyrics, chord symbols) for popular songs, allowing musicians to "fake" their way through unfamiliar material. Fake books were historically illegal due to copyright infringement.

**Example**: The "Real Book," created by Berklee students in the 1970s, became the definitive (originally bootleg) jazz fake book.

**Source**: Wikipedia - Jam Session

---

## Laying Out

**Definition**: Temporarily stopping playing while other musicians continue, allowing space in the music and highlighting other instruments. Knowing when to lay out is as important as knowing what to play.

**Example**: A pianist might lay out during a bass solo to let the bassist and drummer interact.

**Source**: Columbia Jazz Glossary

---

## Modal (Approach to Harmony)

**Definition**: A harmonic approach that emphasizes scales (modes) rather than rapid chord changes, allowing musicians to improvise over sustained harmonies. Modal jazz reduces the complexity of bebop's chord progressions in favor of melodic exploration.

**Example**: Miles Davis's "Kind of Blue" (1959) is the definitive modal jazz album.

**Source**: Wikipedia - Kind of Blue

---

## Pocket (Being "in the pocket")

**Definition**: The state of perfect rhythmic alignment between musicians, where the groove feels effortless and the music seems to play itself. Being in the pocket means everyone is locked in together rhythmically.

**Example**: "Once the bass and drums locked in, the whole band was in the pocket."

**Source**: Wikipedia - Groove (music)

---

## Polyrhythm

**Definition**: The simultaneous use of two or more contrasting rhythmic patterns, creating complex rhythmic textures. Polyrhythm is foundational to jazz, reflecting its African musical heritage.

**Example**: A drummer might play a pattern in groups of three against a bassist playing in groups of four.

---

## Tritone Substitution

**Definition**: A harmonic technique where a dominant seventh chord is replaced by another dominant seventh chord whose root is a tritone (three whole steps) away. This works because both chords share the same guide tones (third and seventh), creating smooth voice leading and chromatic bass motion.

**Example**: In a ii-V-I in C (Dm7-G7-CMaj7), the G7 can be replaced with Db7, creating the progression Dm7-Db7-CMaj7.

**Source**: Wikipedia - Tritone Substitution

---

## 12-Bar Blues

**Definition**: A foundational jazz and blues form consisting of 12 measures using three primary chords (I, IV, V) in a specific pattern. The form typically divides into three four-bar phrases, often with an AAB lyrical structure.

## Vamp

**Definition**: A repeated chord progression or rhythmic figure, often used as an introduction, ending, or background for solos. Vamps provide a stable harmonic foundation and can continue indefinitely until cued to move on.

**Example**: The opening of "A Love Supreme" features a signature vamp on one chord.

**Source**: Columbia Jazz Glossary

---

## Voicing

**Definition**: The specific arrangement of notes within a chord, including which notes are included, their order, and their spacing. Jazz voicings often omit the root (left to the bassist), emphasize guide tones (third and seventh), and add extensions (9ths, 11ths, 13ths).

**Example**: A pianist playing Cmaj7 might voice it as E-B-D-G rather than C-E-G-B.

**Source**: The Jazz Piano Site - Chord Voicings

---

## Walking Bass

**Definition**: A bass line technique featuring steady quarter notes that outline chord tones while moving stepwise or in small intervals through the harmony, creating forward momentum and defining the pulse. Walking bass is fundamental to swing and bebop.
