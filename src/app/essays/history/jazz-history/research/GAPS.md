# Jazz Visual Essay: Research Gaps and Limitations

> What couldn't be verified — DO NOT claim in spec

---

## Critical Gaps (Do Not Claim)

### 1. What Buddy Bolden Sounded Like
**Status**: UNVERIFIABLE

- No recordings of Buddy Bolden exist or have ever been authenticated
- The "thrown away as trash" recording story is unsubstantiated
- Donald Marquis found no documentary evidence of any recordings
- All descriptions of his sound come from secondhand accounts decades later

**Spec Guidance**: Do NOT describe Bolden's specific sound. Can describe his influence through the testimony of those who heard him.

---

### 2. Exact Dates of Many Early Events
**Status**: APPROXIMATE ONLY

Many events before 1917 rely on oral history and memory:
- When exactly Bolden's band became active (c. 1895)
- Precise dates of early performances
- When various musicians first played together

**Spec Guidance**: Use "circa" or "around" for pre-1917 dates. Do not present approximate dates as precise.

---

### 3. Etymology of "Jazz"
**Status**: DISPUTED/UNCERTAIN

Multiple competing theories:
- From "jasm" (energy, vigor)
- From African/Creole sources
- From a musician's name
- Sexual slang origin
- Sports journalism origin

No definitive scholarly consensus exists.

**Spec Guidance**: Do NOT assert a definitive etymology. If addressing, present as "origin disputed" or "multiple theories exist."

---

### 4. Full Extent of Creole-Black Musical Exchange
**Status**: LARGELY UNDOCUMENTED

- How exactly did Creole (French/African/Caribbean) and American Black musical traditions merge?
- What specific techniques were exchanged?
- How did social dynamics affect musical collaboration?

Little documentary evidence exists for specific musical exchanges.

**Spec Guidance**: Discuss the general phenomenon of exchange but avoid specific claims about what technique came from where.

---

### 5. Bunk Johnson's Claims
**Status**: DISPUTED/LIKELY FALSE

Bunk Johnson claimed:
- To have played with Buddy Bolden
- To have taught Louis Armstrong

**Problems**:
- His birth date is disputed (1879 vs. 1889)
- No independent verification exists
- Johnson was known for self-aggrandizing stories

**Spec Guidance**: Do NOT present Johnson's claims as fact. If including Johnson, note the disputes.

---

### 6. Keppard's Exact Reasons for Refusing to Record
**Status**: SPECULATED

The story that Keppard refused to record to prevent people from "stealing my stuff" is:
- Based on secondhand accounts
- Not directly sourced from Keppard
- Economic factors may have been equally important

**Spec Guidance**: Present as "reportedly" or "according to contemporary accounts" rather than as verified fact.

---

### 7. Accuracy of Jelly Roll Morton's Accounts
**Status**: PARTIALLY UNRELIABLE

Scholars note that Morton "told things as he preferred to remember them":
- His birth year claim (1885) contradicted by records (1890)
- His "invented jazz in 1902" claim is exaggerated
- Some stories are embellished or self-aggrandizing

**Spec Guidance**: Morton's claims should be presented as his perspective, not objective fact. His actual documented contributions are significant enough without exaggeration.

---

### 8. Specific Mentor-Student Relationships
**Status**: OFTEN CLAIMED WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION

Many claimed teacher-student relationships lack documentation:
- Did Bolden directly influence specific musicians?
- Did certain older musicians actually "teach" younger ones?

**Spec Guidance**: Focus on documented collaborations rather than claimed mentorships.

---

## Secondary Gaps (Approach with Caution)

### 9. Early Women Instrumentalists
**Status**: UNDER-DOCUMENTED

- Many women instrumentalists existed but were not photographed or recorded
- Documentation bias means we know more about vocalists
- Full extent of women's instrumental contributions is still being recovered

**Spec Guidance**: Acknowledge documentation gaps when discussing women instrumentalists. "Many women instrumentalists existed whose work is not well-documented."

---

### 10. Non-US Jazz Scenes Before 1950
**Status**: VARIABLE DOCUMENTATION

Some international scenes are well-documented (Paris, later Copenhagen), others less so:
- Early Latin American jazz
- Asian jazz before American occupation
- African jazz before independence era

**Spec Guidance**: Focus on well-documented international scenes. Don't claim comprehensive global coverage.

---

### 11. Economics of Early Jazz
**Status**: FRAGMENTARY

- Who exactly paid whom in early New Orleans?
- What were actual earnings for Black vs. white musicians?
- How did recording contracts actually work?

Some information exists but comprehensive economic history is incomplete.

**Spec Guidance**: Present documented examples rather than generalizations about economics.

---

### 12. Integration Before Goodman
**Status**: DOCUMENTED BUT INCOMPLETE

We know integrated performances happened before Goodman's groups, but:
- Full documentation is incomplete
- Many informal integrations went unrecorded
- The "first" claims are often wrong

**Spec Guidance**: Present Goodman's integration as "among the first major" rather than "the first."

## Myths to Avoid Repeating

### DEFINITIVELY FALSE

| Claim | Status | What to Say Instead |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Jazz was born in Storyville | FALSE | Jazz developed throughout New Orleans |
| Storyville's closure caused jazz migration | FALSE | Migration was part of the Great Migration; Storyville closure was incidental |
| Jazz came north on riverboats | MOSTLY FALSE | Jazz migrated primarily via Illinois Central Railroad |
| ODJB invented jazz | FALSE | ODJB made first recording; jazz existed for decades before |
| Nick LaRocca's "white music" claims | FALSE | Rejected by historians |
| Buddy Bolden made recordings | UNVERIFIED | No authenticated recordings exist |

### EXAGGERATED

| Claim | Status | What to Say Instead |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Jelly Roll Morton invented jazz | EXAGGERATED | Morton was among the first to write down jazz arrangements |
| Bebop was purely political protest | NUANCED | Bebop was both artistic revolution and cultural assertion |
| Benny Goodman "integrated jazz" | SIMPLIFIED | Goodman led among the first major integrated groups |

## Research Confidence Matrix

| Topic | Verification Level | Source Quality |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| Recording dates (post-1917) | HIGH | Primary documents |
| Major figures (biographies) | HIGH | Multiple sources |
| Major events | HIGH | Contemporary accounts |
| Early New Orleans (pre-1910) | MEDIUM | Oral history, some documents |
| Women's contributions | MEDIUM | Growing scholarship |
| Global jazz | VARIABLE | Depends on region |
| Economic details | LOW-MEDIUM | Fragmentary |
| Exact musical innovations | MEDIUM | Scholarly analysis |

## Spec Writing Rules

Based on this gap analysis:

1. **Never present approximate dates as precise** — Use "circa," "around," "by the early 1920s"

2. **Never claim a definitive "first"** — Use "among the first," "one of the earliest"

3. **Never describe Bolden's sound** — Describe his influence and reputation only

4. **Never assert jazz etymology** — Note it remains disputed

5. **Never repeat Storyville origin myth** — Jazz developed throughout New Orleans

6. **Never uncritically repeat Morton's claims** — Note he "claimed" or "said" things

7. **Never claim comprehensive coverage of women** — Acknowledge documentation gaps

8. **Never claim to cover "all" global jazz** — Focus on documented scenes

9. **Never present integration as simple narrative** — Acknowledge complexity

10. **Never treat bebop as purely political** — Present as both artistic and cultural
