## DEBATES

### 1. "Bebop as Protest"
**Claim**: Bebop was conscious political protest against white-controlled commercialism.

**Evidence for**: Amiri Baraka's *Blues People*; "Double V" campaign context; exclusive culture created

**Evidence against**:
- Dizzy Gillespie: "We didn't go out and make speeches or say, 'Let's play eight bars of protest.'"
- Parker and Gillespie hired white musicians in early bop bands

**Verdict**: Nuanced - both aesthetic revolution and cultural assertion, with varying individual intent.

### 2. "Selling Out" (Fusion)
Stanley Crouch criticized *Bitches Brew* as "sellout." But:
- Fusion connected to Sly Stone, James Brown, Hendrix
- Teo Macero's production innovations comparable to George Martin

### 3. Free Jazz Backlash
"Anti-jazz" label coined by *Down Beat*'s John Tynan (1961)
- Applied to Coltrane, Dolphy, Coleman
- *Down Beat* dual review of *Free Jazz*: 5 stars (Welding) vs. 0 stars (Tynan)
- Now recognized as legitimate jazz tradition extension
