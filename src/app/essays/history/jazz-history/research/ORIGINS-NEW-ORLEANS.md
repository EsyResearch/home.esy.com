## MYTHS ASSESSMENT

### Myth 1: Storyville Was the Birthplace of Jazz
**Status**: LARGELY DEBUNKED
- Bruce Boyd Raeburn demonstrated Storyville's closing was "essentially a non-event"
- Musicians toured vaudeville and riverboat circuits before closure
- Jazz developed throughout New Orleans, not just Storyville

### Myth 2: Buddy Bolden Made Recordings
**Status**: UNVERIFIED / LIKELY FALSE
- No recordings have ever been authenticated
- "Thrown away as trash" story is unsubstantiated
- Donald Marquis found no documentary evidence

### Myth 3: Jelly Roll Morton "Invented Jazz" in 1902
**Status**: EXAGGERATED BUT CONTAINS TRUTH
- Morton was not sole inventor; Bolden and others preceded him
- Morton WAS first to write down jazz arrangements
- His claim reflects pioneering role in codifying jazz composition

### Myth 4: Keppard Refused Recording to Prevent Imitation
**Status**: PARTIALLY VERIFIED / DISPUTED
- Keppard DID refuse Victor's 1916 offer - verified
- "Steal my stuff" explanation not directly sourced
- Economic factors may have been equally important

### Myth 5: Bunk Johnson Played with Bolden and Taught Armstrong
**Status**: DISPUTED / LIKELY FALSE
- Birth date disputes undermine timeline
- No independent verification exists
- Johnson known for self-aggrandizing stories

### Myth 6: Nick LaRocca and ODJB "Invented Jazz"
**Status**: DEFINITIVELY FALSE
- ODJB made first RECORDING, not first jazz music
- Jazz clearly evolved from African American traditions
- LaRocca's claims rejected by historians

### Myth 7: Jazz Came North on Riverboats After Storyville Closed
**Status**: PARTIALLY FALSE
- Jazz came via Illinois Central Railroad, not riverboats
- Chicago had jazz venues before Storyville closed (Pekin Theater, 1904)
- Migration was part of broader Great Migration
