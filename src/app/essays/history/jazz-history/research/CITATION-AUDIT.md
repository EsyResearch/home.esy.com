## Minor Notes (Non-Blocking)

1. **Jelly Roll Morton birth date**: Listed as "c. 1890" — historically disputed (1885-1890). The "c." prefix appropriately indicates uncertainty.

2. **Some featured figures lack images**: John Coltrane, Art Blakey marked as `isFeatured: true` without `imageUrl`. LOC Gottlieb Collection may not include suitable public domain images for all figures.

3. **Quote attributions**: All direct quotes are attributed. Some epigraphs are paraphrased observations rather than direct quotes — clearly marked.
