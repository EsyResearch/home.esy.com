**Persistent Segregation**:
- Cotton Club: Black performers barred from audience
- Southern touring required presenting integrated members as "novelty"
- Record companies limited exposure for Black bands

**Lionel Hampton**: "What [Goodman] did in those days - and they were hard days in 1937 - made it possible for Negroes to have their chance in baseball and other fields."

## WWII IMPACT (1941-1945)

**Factors in Big Band Decline**:
1. Draft depleted musician pool (2M to 12M)
2. Glenn Miller lost entertaining troops (1944)
3. Material shortages (instruments)
4. Shellac rationing (1942)
5. Gasoline rationing
6. Musicians' strike (1942-1944)
