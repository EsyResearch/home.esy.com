## Specific Research Questions to Answer

### Origins & Context
1. Why is New Orleans specifically credited as Jazz birthplace — and what are the limits of this claim?
2. What was the actual role of Storyville in Jazz development (separate myth from documentation)?
3. How did Creole/Black cultural exchange function musically and socially?
4. What were the economic structures of early Jazz (who paid whom, who owned venues)?

### Technology & Industry
5. How did early recording technology shape what Jazz "sounded like" (what could/couldn't be captured)?
6. Who controlled access to recording and why?
7. How did radio broadcasting change Jazz dissemination?
8. What was the business model of Jazz clubs across eras?

### Migration & Spread
9. What were the specific routes and dates of Jazz migration (New Orleans → Chicago → New York)?
10. How did Prohibition-era economies shape Jazz venues?
11. When and how did Jazz reach each major global city?

### Social Dynamics
12. How did segregation shape Jazz economics (integrated influence, segregated money)?
13. What was the role of women instrumentalists (not just vocalists) across eras?
14. How were Jazz musicians organized (unions, collectives)?

### Evolution & Debate
15. What sparked the Bebop "revolution" — artistic and economic factors?
16. How did Jazz education institutionalize (conservatories, "real books")?
17. What are the documented debates about "selling out" vs. innovation?

- [ ] "Benny Goodman integrated Jazz" — Earlier integrated performances?
- [ ] "Bebop was a protest against commercialism" — Economic vs. artistic factors
- [ ] "Jazz is dead" — Evidence of contemporary vitality

**Gate 1 Status**: APPROVED

**Director Notes**: This is a major undertaking requiring comprehensive research across multiple eras, geographies, and source types. The user's prompt is exceptionally detailed and serves as creative direction. Research must be equally rigorous — no shortcuts on verification. The emphasis on avoiding "smoky club clichés" and centering Black American innovation with specificity is critical.
