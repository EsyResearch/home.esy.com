# LAYER 6: PRODUCTION NOTES

## Voice and Tone

### Primary Voice
- Authoritative but accessible
- Museum-quality gravitas without academic stuffiness
- Respect for artists and fans alike
- Critical without cynical
- Celebratory without hagiographic

### Tonal Shifts by Section
- **Pre-K-Pop**: Elegiac, historical weight
- **The Factory**: Analytical, systems-focused
- **The Fever**: Energetic, participatory
- **The Future**: Reflective, honest about uncertainty

### What to Avoid
- Stan language or excessive superlatives
- Dismissive tone toward any generation or genre
- False equivalence between agency profit and artist wellbeing
- Prediction confidence about uncertain futures
- Romanticizing the "struggle" without acknowledging harm

| Prologue | Slow, atmospheric | Long scroll distances |
| Part I | Building momentum | Medium scroll |
| Part II | High energy | Faster scroll, more interactions |
| Part III | Measured, weighty | Slower scroll for difficult content |
| Epilogue | Reflective | Long final scroll |

## Accessibility Requirements

- Alt text for all images
- Transcript option for any audio
- Reduced motion mode
- High contrast option
- Korean romanization hover definitions
- Content warnings for Chapter 17

## Citation Standards
