## HANDLING RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Visual Essay Production

1. **Acknowledge uncertainty**: Where gaps exist, use language like "documented cases show" rather than "the industry always"

2. **Avoid false precision**: Don't cite specific numbers where only ranges are verified

3. **Favor recent over historical**: More verification available for 2010s-2020s than earlier periods

4. **Use representative examples**: When comprehensive data unavailable, present documented cases as illustrative, not universal

5. **Note ongoing disputes**: Many topics (NewJeans, contract reform effectiveness) are actively contested

---

## FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES

If essay expands or requires deeper investigation:

1. **Korean-language academic sources**: Many gaps reflect English-language limitations
2. **Industry insider interviews**: Primary sources would fill many operational gaps
3. **Financial filing analysis**: HYBE, SM, JYP, YG public filings contain useful data
4. **Longitudinal studies**: Track artist outcomes over time
5. **Comparative research**: How K-Pop compares to J-Pop, Western pop systems
