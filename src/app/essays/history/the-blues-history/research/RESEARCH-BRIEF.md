## TOP-LINE FINDINGS

### 1. The Blues Cannot Be Traced to a Single Origin
The blues emerged between 1870-1900 across the American South, synthesizing field hollers, work songs, spirituals, and African musical elements. No single "inventor" or birthplace exists.

### 2. Economic Oppression Created the Blues
Sharecropping, debt peonage, and forced labor in the post-Civil War South directly shaped blues themes and provided the context for its emergence.

### 3. Women Dominated the Commercial Blues Era
The 1920s "Classic Blues" era was led by women: Mamie Smith, Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Ida Cox. Men entered recording later as "country blues" artists.

### 4. The Recording Industry Systematically Exploited Artists
Standard practice: flat session fees ($25-100), no royalties, copyright assigned to producers. Bessie Smith "made Columbia millions" but was "never paid royalties."

### 5. The Crossroads Legend Is Folklore, Not History
The Robert Johnson "sold his soul" story originated from stories about Tommy Johnson (different person) and has no documented basis in Johnson's own claims.

### 6. Chicago Electric Blues Transformed the Genre
Migration brought Delta blues to Chicago; amplification transformed it. Muddy Waters: "Couldn't nobody hear you with an acoustic."

### 7. British Musicians Reintroduced Blues to White America
The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, and others learned from American blues records and brought the music back to mainstream white audiences in the 1960s.

### 8. Blues Is the Foundation of American Popular Music
Jazz, R&B, rock and roll, soul, and hip-hop all trace direct lineage to the blues.

## ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR PRODUCTION

### DO:
- Present women as central figures, not sidebar
- Acknowledge exploitation without making it the only story
- Present crossroads as legend, not fact
- Credit African American scholarship (Angela Davis, etc.)
- Note Lomax complexity (preservationist and exploiter)

### DO NOT:
- Use "primitive" or "raw" language that strips agency
- Present blues as purely suffering music (also celebration, resistance)
- Treat any "first" claim as absolute
- Romanticize poverty/hardship
- Erase women from the narrative
