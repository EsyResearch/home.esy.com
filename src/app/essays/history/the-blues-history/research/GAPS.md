## PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This file catalogs what CANNOT be verified despite thorough research. For a visual essay committed to accuracy, these gaps are as important as confirmed facts. They help distinguish between:

- **Documented history** (can be cited with confidence)
- **Scholarly consensus** (widely accepted but not definitively proven)
- **Contested claims** (competing credible interpretations)
- **Oral tradition/folklore** (document as such, not as fact)
- **Missing documentation** (gaps that may never be filled)

---

## SECTION 1: CONTESTED "FIRSTS"

### The First Blues Song

**The Problem:** Multiple competing claims; depends on definition of "blues"

| Claim | Evidence | Issues |
|-------|----------|--------|
| W.C. Handy's "Memphis Blues" (1912) | First published blues composition | Handy codified existing form; didn't invent it |
| Antonio Maggio's "I Got the Blues" (1908) | Earlier publication | May not be "blues" by later definition |
| Oral tradition (1870s-1890s) | Documented by Peabody (1901-02), Handy (c. 1903) | No recordings or publications |

**Recommendation:** Avoid claiming any specific "first blues song." Instead: "Blues emerged as a recognizable form in the 1880s-1890s, with the first published blues compositions appearing around 1912."

---

### The First Blues Recording

**The Problem:** Depends on how "blues" is defined

| Claim | Date | Issues |
|-------|------|--------|
| Mamie Smith's "Crazy Blues" | August 1920 | First blues by Black artist, but not first blues recording overall |
| Mamie Smith's "That Thing Called Love" | February 1920 | Same artist, earlier, but less clearly "blues" |
| Various white artists | Pre-1920 | Some "blues" songs recorded, but genre definition unclear |

**Recommendation:** Mamie Smith's "Crazy Blues" (1920) was the first commercially successful blues recording by an African American artist and launched the race records industry. This is the defensible claim.

---

### The "Father" of Blues

**The Problem:** Multiple legitimate claimants; term is inherently subjective

| Candidate | Claim Basis | Limitations |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| W.C. Handy | Self-described; first to publish/codify | Documented existing tradition, didn't create it |
| Charley Patton | "Father of Delta Blues" designation | Regional, not universal |
| Multiple pre-recording figures | Oral tradition | Undocumented |

**Recommendation:** Use specific, qualified titles: "W.C. Handy, who called himself 'Father of the Blues'" or "Charley Patton, widely considered the Father of Delta Blues."

---

### First Electric Blues Recording / First Use of Electric Guitar

**The Problem:** Transitional period with incomplete documentation

**Competing Claims:**
- Memphis Minnie used electric guitar before Muddy Waters
- T-Bone Walker pioneered electric blues guitar
- Muddy Waters' "Country Boy" (1952) documented as early amplified harmonica

**Recommendation:** "Memphis Minnie was among the first blues artists to use electric guitar, preceding Muddy Waters by a year" - this is sourced. Avoid absolute "first" claims.

---

## SECTION 2: UNVERIFIABLE LEGENDS (Document as Folklore, Not Fact)

### The Robert Johnson Crossroads Legend

**The Legend:** Johnson sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads at midnight

**What We CANNOT Verify:**
- That Johnson ever made this claim himself
- That any supernatural event occurred
- The specific location of "the crossroads"

**What We CAN Document:**
- The legend exists and is widely known
- It likely originated from stories about Tommy Johnson (different person)
- Tommy Johnson's brother told the story to researchers in the 1960s
- Multiple Mississippi towns claim to be "the crossroads"
- Some scholars connect it to West African Legba tradition

**Recommendation:** "According to legend, Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads - a story scholars trace not to Johnson himself but to an earlier musician, Tommy Johnson. No evidence supports this as historical fact, though the legend has become inseparable from Johnson's mystique."

---

### Robert Johnson's Death

**The Legend:** Poisoned by jealous husband at Three Forks juke joint

**What We CANNOT Verify:**
- Exact cause of death
- Who (if anyone) poisoned him
- Precise location of death
- Details of final days

**What We CAN Document:**
- Death certificate lists syphilis
- Family and researchers allege poisoning
- Died near Greenwood, Mississippi, August 1938
- Three Forks juke joint commonly cited as location

**Recommendation:** Present multiple accounts: "Johnson died near Greenwood, Mississippi, in August 1938, at age 27. His death certificate cites syphilis, but family members and researchers have long alleged he was poisoned, possibly at a juke joint called Three Forks."

---

### The "Rediscovery" Narratives

**The Myth:** Blues artists were found living in complete obscurity, having stopped playing music

**What We CANNOT Always Verify:**
- Whether artists had truly stopped performing locally
- Whether they were truly "forgotten" or just unknown to white audiences
- Extent of their continued musical activity

**What We CAN Document:**
- Many "rediscovered" artists had continued playing locally
- "Discovery" often meant discovery by white collectors/audiences
- Some artists had genuinely stopped (Son House at Rochester train station)

**Recommendation:** Use "rediscovered" with awareness that it often reflects white audience perspective, not absolute obscurity.

---

### W.C. Handy's Tutwiler Encounter

**The Story:** Handy heard a ragged man playing guitar with a knife at Tutwiler train station (c. 1903)

**What We CANNOT Verify:**
- Exact date
- Identity of the unknown musician
- Whether the encounter happened exactly as described

**What We CAN Document:**
- Handy recounted this story multiple times
- The story is consistent with known blues practices of the era
- It represents Handy's first conscious encounter with blues as a distinct form

**Recommendation:** "Handy later recalled..." or "According to Handy's memoirs..." - attribution to source.

---

## SECTION 3: MISSING DOCUMENTATION FOR EARLY PERFORMERS

### Figures Known Only Through Oral History

| Figure | What's Known | What's Missing |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Henry Sloan** | Taught Charley Patton at Dockery; played "unusual style" | Birth/death dates, photographs, any recordings |
| **Pre-recording Delta musicians** | Existence attested by later musicians | Names, biographical details, musical specifics |
| **Many women blues singers** | Existence documented | Full careers often unrecorded |

---

### Incomplete Birth Records

| Artist | Birth Year Issue |
|--------|------------------|
| Charley Patton | Various sources cite 1881, 1885, 1887, 1891 |
| Bukka White | "Various years between 1900 and 1909" cited |
| Blind Blake | Birth year, location, real name all disputed |
| Ida Cox | Sources give 1888, 1894, or 1896 |

**Recommendation:** When birth years are uncertain, cite range or most commonly accepted year with qualifier: "born around 1891" or "born c. 1891."

---

### Unknown Death Circumstances

| Artist | Death Circumstances |
|--------|-------------------|
| Robert Johnson | Poisoning vs. syphilis disputed |
| Blind Lemon Jefferson | "Mysterious circumstances" - possibly exposure in snowstorm |
| Blind Blake | Death year, location, circumstances all unknown |
| Bessie Smith | Disputed whether she was denied care at white hospital |

---

## SECTION 4: EXPLOITATION WITHOUT PAPER TRAIL

### What We Know Happened But Cannot Always Document Specifically

**Systemic Practices (Well-Documented):**
- Flat session fees instead of royalties
- Copyright assigned to producers/labels
- Illiterate artists signed away rights
- Accounting manipulation in royalties (when paid)

**Specific Cases Where Documentation Exists:**
- Bessie Smith: Columbia statement that she was never paid royalties
- Big Mama Thornton: Her own statement about $500 for "Hound Dog"
- Lester Melrose: Documented ownership of 3,000+ copyrights

**What We CANNOT Document:**
- Exact amounts for many artists
- Total industry profit vs. artist payment
- Complete accounting records (most destroyed or lost)
- Verbal agreements that were never written

**Recommendation:** Use documented specific cases (Thornton, Smith) as representative examples. Avoid fabricating numbers for undocumented cases.

---

### The Lomax Recordings: Ethical Ambiguity

**What We CANNOT Fully Assess:**
- Whether prisoners truly consented (prison context)
- Fair market value of recordings at time
- Complete compensation history
- Artists' own feelings (limited documentation)

**What We CAN Document:**
- Recordings were made
- Some artists (Lead Belly) had ongoing relationship with Lomaxes
- Some criticism exists in scholarly literature
- Library of Congress acknowledges ethical complexity

**Recommendation:** "The ethics of the Lomax recordings remain debated, with scholars noting both the invaluable preservation achieved and the problematic power dynamics inherent in recording imprisoned or impoverished artists."

---

## SECTION 5: REGIONAL HISTORY GAPS

### The Mississippi Delta Before Recording

**What We Know:**
- Blues was being performed at Dockery Plantation and surrounding areas by 1900s
- Charley Patton was central figure
- Musician community existed and developed distinctive style

**What We Cannot Document:**
- Complete roster of musicians
- Specific musical evolution
- Performance contexts beyond oral history
- Whether Delta was truly "first" or just best documented

---

### Other Regions' Early History

| Region | Documentation Gap |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Texas** | Pre-Jefferson blues performers poorly documented |
| **Piedmont** | Origins of fingerpicking style unclear |
| **Memphis** | Pre-Handy blues history fragmentary |

---

## SECTION 6: CLAIMS TO HANDLE WITH CARE

### Phrases to Avoid Without Qualification

| Claim | Problem | Alternative |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| "The blues was born in..." | No single birthplace | "The blues emerged across the American South..." |
| "The first blues musician" | Unprovable | "Among the earliest documented blues musicians" |
| "[Artist] invented the blues" | No one person did | "[Artist] was foundational to the blues tradition" |
| "Johnson sold his soul" (as fact) | Legend, not history | "According to legend..." |
| "The blues went to Chicago" | Oversimplifies | "Blues musicians migrated to Chicago..." |

---

### Statistics to Use Carefully

| Statistic | Source | Confidence |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| "Crazy Blues" sold 1 million in first year | Multiple sources | MEDIUM - exact figure varies |
| 6 million African Americans in Great Migration | Census data | HIGH |
| Race records sales $100M (1927) to $6M (1933) | Industry sources | MEDIUM - estimates |
| 15,000 race record titles released | Encyclopedia.com | MEDIUM - estimate |
| Bessie Smith "never paid royalties" | Contemporary accounts | HIGH - but absolute "never" uncertain |

---

## SECTION 7: WHAT FUTURE RESEARCH MIGHT RESOLVE

### Archives Not Yet Fully Processed

1. **Robert "Mack" McCormick Archive** (Smithsonian)
   - 590 reels, 165 boxes just donated
   - May contain new information on many artists

2. **Paramount Records Documentation**
   - Company records largely lost
   - Some may exist in private collections

3. **Local Court Records**
   - Birth, death, marriage, criminal records in Southern counties
   - May clarify biographical uncertainties

### Oral Histories Still Being Collected

- Living relatives of early blues musicians
- Musicians who knew legends (increasingly rare)
- Community members with institutional memory

---

## SECTION 8: FRAMEWORK FOR PRESENTING UNCERTAIN INFORMATION

### Graduated Certainty Language

**HIGH Confidence (cite directly):**
- "According to Library of Congress records..."
- "Documented in court records..."
- "As stated in his/her own interview..."

**MEDIUM Confidence (acknowledge source):**
- "Scholars generally agree that..."
- "Contemporary accounts suggest..."
- "As [scholar name] argues in [work]..."

**LOW Confidence (qualify heavily):**
- "According to legend..."
- "Some sources claim..."
- "The precise details remain disputed..."

**UNKNOWN (acknowledge gap):**
- "The historical record does not preserve..."
- "Documentation from this period is incomplete..."
- "This aspect of [artist's] life remains undocumented..."

---

## CONCLUSION: The Unknowable Foundation

The blues emerged from communities that:
- Were systematically denied literacy
- Left few written records
- Were not considered worthy of documentation by contemporary observers
- Had their stories recorded mainly by outsiders, often decades later

This means that every history of the blues is necessarily incomplete. The gaps in this document are not failures of research but reflections of historical injustice - the same conditions that created the blues also ensured that much of its early history would be lost.

The visual essay should embrace this uncertainty as part of the story: the blues comes from people whose full history cannot be recovered, and that absence is itself meaningful.
