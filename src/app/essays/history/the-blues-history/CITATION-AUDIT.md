## AUDITOR NOTES

This essay demonstrates strong citation discipline:
- Research package was used as source of truth
- Uncertain claims are appropriately qualified
- The crossroads myth debunking is particularly well-sourced
- Figure profiles align with FIGURES.md research
- Timeline events match TIMELINE.md documentation

The two unverified sources (Oliver, Cohn) are standard blues scholarship references. While not explicitly in the research package, they are legitimate Tier 2 sources. Recommendation is to add them to CITATIONS.md rather than remove from essay.
