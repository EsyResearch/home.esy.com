# Design Research Report: Jazz — The Sound of Freedom in Real Time

**Date**: December 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Gate**: G4 - Design Research

## Design Research Overview

Jazz is America's original art form—a music born from the collision of African diasporic traditions and European instruments in New Orleans, spreading across the world as both sonic innovation and cultural force. The visual identity must honor jazz's material reality (brass instruments, vinyl records, smoke-filled clubs), its cultural weight (Black American innovation, segregation, integration), and its philosophical core (improvisation, conversation, freedom).

**Key Design Challenge**: Jazz spans 130+ years and multiple distinct eras, each with its own visual language. The design must create a unified identity while honoring era-specific aesthetics—from the formal portraits of New Orleans pioneers to the modernist Blue Note covers to contemporary concert photography.

## Visual Identity Analysis

### Subject Matter Characteristics

**Jazz IS**:
- Improvisational — responds in the moment, never exactly the same twice
- Conversational — call-and-response, dialogue between instruments
- Rooted in African American culture — born from spirituals, blues, work songs
- Material-specific — brass instruments, wooden stages, vinyl records
- Era-spanning — visual identity evolved dramatically from 1900s to present
- Nocturnal — clubs, after-hours sessions, spotlight and shadow
- Virtuosic — technical mastery expressed through spontaneity

**Jazz is NOT**:
- Sterile or clinical — it's warm, human, embodied
- Static — it's always moving, breathing, responding
- Monolithic — many eras, many styles, many visual languages
- Digital-native — its golden age was pre-digital; analog warmth matters
- Colorless — despite B&W photography dominance, jazz evokes rich tones

### Visual Treatment Decision

**Primary Medium**: Archival Photography (photorealistic)

**Rationale**:
1. **Historical richness**: The Library of Congress Gottlieb Collection (1,600 photos, public domain) provides unmatched documentation of 1938-1948
2. **Human-centered story**: Jazz is told through faces—Buddy Bolden's single photograph, Armstrong's wide smile, Billie Holiday's gardenia
3. **Authenticity**: Real photographs from real moments carry weight illustrations cannot replicate
4. **Era differentiation**: Photo processing (sepia, B&W, color) naturally distinguishes periods
5. **Material connection**: Photographs capture the physical reality—the brass, the smoke, the sweat

## Visual Archaeology Findings

### Primary Materials & Associations

**Materials**:
- **Brass** — trumpets, trombones, saxophones (warm gold/amber tones)
- **Lacquered wood** — piano keys, double bass, club stages (deep browns, honeyed amber)
- **Vinyl** — records, album covers (black with rainbow sheen)
- **Smoke** — cigarettes, atmosphere (blue-gray haze)
- **Velvet** — curtains, upholstery (deep reds, midnight blue)
- **Neon** — club marquees, 52nd Street (electric colors against night)

**Textures**:
- Worn brass with patina (lived-in warmth)
- Wood grain of stages and instruments
- Grainy photography (documentary authenticity)
- Velvet softness (club interiors)
- Glossy vinyl surfaces

**Era Associations**:
| Era | Visual Character | Dominant Materials |
|-----|------------------|-------------------|
| New Orleans (1890s-1920) | Formal, dignified, sepia | Brass, parade banners |
| Jazz Age (1920s) | Glamorous, Art Deco | Neon, sequins, champagne |
| Swing (1930s-45) | Polish, professionalism | Ballroom elegance, tuxedos |
| Bebop (1945-55) | Intimate, noir, smoky | Dim clubs, spotlights |
| Blue Note (1955-65) | Modernist, graphic | Album covers, studio |
| Free/Fusion (1965-80) | Psychedelic, cosmic | Robes, electronics |
| Contemporary | Institutional, diverse | Concert halls, festivals |

**Emotional Tone**:
- Warm (brass and wood) but with cool undertones (blue notes, midnight sessions)
- Sophisticated but not pretentious
- Historical but not dusty
- Nocturnal — the feeling of late-night revelation

### Historical Color Associations

From subject materials, the following colors emerge:

| Color | Source | Derivation |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Brass Gold** | Trumpet, saxophone, cornet | The actual color of polished brass instruments |
| **Midnight Blue** | Night sky, Blue Note aesthetic, "blue notes" | The color of late-night sessions, the music's melancholic undertone |
| **Deep Black** | Vinyl records, piano keys, tuxedos | The formal elegance of jazz presentation |
| **Warm Cream** | Ivory piano keys, spotlight glow, vintage paper | The warmth of analog, the color of aged photographs |
| **Smoke Gray** | Cigarette smoke, atmospheric haze | The literal atmosphere of jazz clubs |
| **Velvet Red** | Club curtains, stage velvet | The theatrical setting of performance |
| **Sepia** | Pre-1920 photographs | The aged warmth of early documentation |

### Recurring Visual Motifs

1. **The Musical Staff** — Five lines, notes accumulating
   - Subject connection: The universal language of jazz notation
   - Usage: Progress indicator, section dividers

2. **Brass Bell** — The flared end of a trumpet or trombone
   - Subject connection: The most iconic silhouette of jazz
   - Usage: Chapter icons, decorative elements

3. **Vinyl Groove** — Concentric circles of a record
   - Subject connection: The medium that preserved and spread jazz
   - Usage: Loading states, era transitions

4. **Smoke Wisps** — Curling atmospheric haze
   - Subject connection: The literal atmosphere of jazz performance
   - Usage: Parallax ambient layer, transitions

5. **Spotlight Circle** — The cone of light on performer
   - Subject connection: The isolation and celebration of the soloist
   - Usage: Figure reveals, hero sequences

## Proposed Color Palette

### Color Derivation Table

| Token | Hex | Source | Derivation |
|-------|-----|--------|------------|
| `--jazz-night` | `#0A0A0F` | Vinyl record, club darkness | The deep black of a record's center, the darkness before the spotlight |
| `--jazz-smoke` | `#1A1A1F` | Cigarette smoke in dim light | Elevated surfaces, slightly lifted from pure black |
| `--jazz-brass` | `#C9A227` | Polished trumpet | Primary accent—the warm gold of a well-maintained horn |
| `--jazz-blue` | `#1A3A5C` | Blue Note covers, "blue notes" | Secondary accent—the cool counterpoint, melancholy undertone |
| `--jazz-cream` | `#F5F0E6` | Aged paper, ivory keys, spotlight | Primary text—warm readability, analog warmth |
| `--jazz-silver` | `#9A9A9A` | Metal valves, cymbal shimmer | Secondary text, captions |
| `--jazz-spotlight` | `#FFFFE0` | Stage spotlight | Highlights, emphasis, key moments |
| `--jazz-sepia` | `#8B7355` | Pre-1920 photographs | Early era background treatment |
| `--jazz-velvet` | `#4A1C2E` | Club curtains, stage velvet | Accent for theatrical moments |
| `--jazz-noir` | `#0D0D0D` | Bebop shadows | Deepest blacks for dramatic contrast |

### Color Psychology Justification

- **Brass Gold (#C9A227)**: The defining color of jazz instrumentation. When readers see this gold, they should hear brass. Derived from actual trumpet finish, not arbitrary "warm accent."

- **Midnight Blue (#1A3A5C)**: Jazz is inseparable from the concept of "blue notes"—the slightly flattened notes that give blues and jazz their emotional depth. Blue also evokes the late-night sessions when jazz came alive. This specific shade references the iconic Blue Note Records covers.

- **Deep Black (#0A0A0F)**: Vinyl records are black. Tuxedos are black. The clubs were dark. This isn't generic dark mode—it's the actual color of jazz's physical and social environment.

- **Warm Cream (#F5F0E6)**: Not stark white—the warmth of ivory piano keys, of aged photographs, of spotlight glow on performer's face. This cream has the analog warmth that digital white lacks.

- **Smoke Gray (#1A1A1F)**: The literal atmosphere of jazz clubs before smoking bans. The haze through which spotlights cut. A lifted black that provides depth without harsh contrast.

## Typography Selection

### Typography Stack

**Display**: **Playfair Display**
*Because*: Jazz in its golden age was sophisticated, editorial, cultural. Playfair's high contrast and elegant proportions evoke the era of jazz magazines (Down Beat, Metronome), concert posters, and album liner notes. Its serifs connect to the 1920s-1960s when jazz dominated American culture.

**Serif/Body**: **Source Serif Pro**
*Because*: Readable, warm, scholarly—appropriate for an essay that treats jazz with historical seriousness. The slight warmth in its letterforms complements the cream text color and avoids the coldness of purely geometric fonts.

**Quotes**: **Playfair Display Italic**
*Because*: When Charlie Parker or Billie Holiday speaks, their words deserve distinction. The italic variant of the display font provides that distinction while maintaining family unity.

**Technical/Data**: **JetBrains Mono**
*Because*: Dates, years, and data points need clarity. A monospace font provides rhythm (appropriate for music) and precision for timeline markers and technical information.

**Captions**: **Inter**
*Because*: Utilitarian, readable at small sizes, neutral enough to not compete with the editorial typography. Photo captions and source attributions need to be present but not dominant.

### Typography Justification

The typography stack creates a clear hierarchy:
1. **Playfair Display** headlines evoke the editorial sophistication of jazz's cultural moment
2. **Source Serif Pro** body text provides warmth and readability
3. **JetBrains Mono** data creates rhythmic precision
4. **Inter** captions stay out of the way

This is NOT a generic editorial stack—it specifically evokes the 1940s-1960s when jazz was featured in Life Magazine, when album liner notes were essays, when musicians were profiled in New Yorker-style prose.

## Animation Philosophy

### Subject Nature → Animation Approach

**Jazz IS**:
- Improvisational — never exactly the same twice
- Rhythmic — built on swing, syncopation, groove
- Conversational — call-and-response between instruments
- Spontaneous but practiced — virtuosity enables freedom
- Breath-driven — phrasing shaped by human respiration

**Animation SHOULD**:
- Feel like **breathing** — inhale (anticipation), exhale (release)
- Have **swing** — not mechanical, slightly behind or ahead of strict timing
- Support **revelation** — the scroll reveals like a solo unfolds
- Be **warm** — cubic-bezier curves, not linear
- Allow **silence** — stillness between movements matters

### Animation Principles

**Scroll-Lock Sequences**:
- Purpose: Create moments of focused attention, like when the room goes quiet for a solo
- Feel: Building tension (lock) → revelation (scroll-driven) → release (unlock)
- Timing: 600-800ms for content transitions within lock
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` — starts slow, accelerates, settles

**Parallax**:
- Intensity: **Moderate** — enough depth to feel immersive, not so much it distracts
- Rationale: Jazz clubs had depth—stage, audience, smoke layers. Parallax recreates this spatial feeling.
- Layers: 5-layer system (background texture, mid figures, subject, overlay text, ambient smoke)

**Animation Timing**:
| Element | Duration | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Text reveal | 400ms stagger, 100ms/line | Reading rhythm, like musical phrasing |
| Photo entrance | 600ms fade + 20px rise | Emergence from shadow into spotlight |
| Quote appearance | 800ms | Words deserve time to land, like a held note |
| Era transition | 1000ms crossfade | Processing shift is significant, needs breath |
| Scroll-lock engage | 400ms ease-out | Quick enough to not frustrate |
| Scroll-lock release | 300ms ease-in | Smooth return to flow |

**Easing Curves**:
- Standard: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` — Material Design's standard curve, appropriate warmth
- Emphasis: `cubic-bezier(0.0, 0, 0.2, 1)` — Accelerating entrance for dramatic reveals
- Exit: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)` — Quick departure, doesn't linger

### The "Swing" Principle

In jazz, "swing" means notes are not played exactly on the beat—they're slightly behind or ahead, creating groove. Animation should have this quality:
- **Not robotic** — avoid linear timing
- **Slight anticipation** — elements can "breathe" before moving
- **Grouped motion** — elements move together like a section (brass, rhythm)
- **Stagger** — sequential reveals, not simultaneous

## Visual Style Guide

### Photography Approach

**Era Processing**:

| Era | Treatment | Rationale |
|-----|-----------|-----------|
| Pre-1920 | Sepia tone, heavy vignette, paper texture | The era of daguerreotypes and formal portraits |
| 1920s | Warm B&W, soft vignette, Art Deco framing | The glamour of the Jazz Age |
| 1930s-45 | Sharp B&W, high contrast, clean edges | The Gottlieb era—professional, editorial |
| 1945-55 | Noir B&W, dramatic shadows, low key | Bebop's intimate club settings |
| 1955-65 | Cool tones, slight blue shift, graphic | The Blue Note aesthetic |
| 1965-80 | Saturated color, high contrast | Fusion's psychedelic energy |
| 1980-present | Full color, contemporary | Modern jazz documentation |

**Photo Principles**:
- **Never mix eras without transition** — processing shifts signal time passage
- **Honor the original** — don't over-filter; enhance, don't distort
- **Respect the archive** — source attribution visible, research provenance matters
- **Human focus** — even in venue shots, look for human presence

### Visual Progression

The essay's visual treatment evolves as jazz evolves:

1. **Opening (Bolden)**: Heavy sepia, mystery, single photograph emerging from darkness
2. **New Orleans**: Formal B&W, parade shots, emerging from sepia
3. **Migration**: Movement imagery, train visual metaphor, B&W sharpening
4. **Swing Era**: Gottlieb aesthetic—sharp, professional, the golden age
5. **Bebop**: Noir treatment, shadows dominate, intimate scale
6. **Blue Note Era**: Cooler tones, modernist graphic sensibility
7. **Free Jazz**: Color emerges, experimental treatments
8. **Contemporary**: Full color, concert hall clarity

This progression mirrors jazz's own evolution from folk art to high art to institution.

## Progress Bar Concept

**Concept**: "The Musical Staff"

The progress bar is a musical staff (five horizontal lines). As the reader scrolls, notes appear on the staff, accumulating into a melodic phrase. Each chapter adds notes corresponding to the era:

| Era | Note Style |
|-----|------------|
| New Orleans | Whole notes (slow, foundational) |
| Swing | Quarter notes (steady pulse) |
| Bebop | Eighth and sixteenth notes (rapid) |
| Free Jazz | Note clusters, unconventional placement |
| Contemporary | Return to clarity, full chord |

**Visual Design**:
- Staff lines: Off-white (#F5F0E6) at 50% opacity on dark background
- Notes: Brass gold (#C9A227) with subtle glow
- Measure bars mark chapter boundaries
- Final state: Full chord (resolution)

**Justification**:
This progress bar could only exist for a jazz essay. It directly references the universal language of music notation while evolving in style to mirror jazz's own evolution. A reader who completes the essay has "played" a phrase of music.

## Layout Pattern Strategy

### Recommended Patterns (minimum 3, no consecutive same)

1. **Full-Bleed Portrait** (`portrait-hero`)
   - For: Figure spotlights—Armstrong, Ellington, Parker, Holiday
   - Rationale: Jazz is human. Faces fill the frame, eyes meet reader's eyes.
   - Usage: Every chapter's key figure moment

2. **Split Comparison** (`split-screen`)
   - For: Contrasts—Cotton Club stage/audience, abroad/home, before/after
   - Rationale: Jazz's story is full of paradoxes and tensions
   - Usage: Cotton Club paradox, Ambassador's paradox, integration moments

3. **Timeline Scroll** (`horizontal-timeline`)
   - For: Era transitions, migration routes, historical progression
   - Rationale: Jazz is a story across time; horizontal movement evokes journey
   - Usage: Great Migration, 52nd Street evolution, global spread

4. **Quote Spotlight** (`centered-quote`)
   - For: Key quotes from musicians—Parker on wisdom, Ellington on music
   - Rationale: Jazz musicians were poets; their words deserve center stage
   - Usage: At least one per chapter

5. **Grid Gallery** (`photo-grid`)
   - For: Ensemble shots, era overviews, venue collections
   - Rationale: Jazz is collective; groups of images show community
   - Usage: Bands, women of jazz, global scenes

6. **Venue Immersion** (`environment-pan`)
   - For: Minton's, Cotton Club, Village Vanguard, 52nd Street
   - Rationale: Jazz happened in specific places; readers should feel transported
   - Usage: Key venue introductions

### Pattern Rotation Strategy

To ensure visual variety:
- Never use same pattern consecutively
- Alternate between human-focused (portrait, quote) and contextual (timeline, venue)
- Use split-screen sparingly—save for key paradoxes
- End chapters with quotes or forward-looking imagery

## Mobile-Native Considerations

### Mobile-First Design

Jazz's audience skews young-curious and older-enthusiast. Both use mobile. Design must work on phone first:

- **Full-bleed images**: No side margins waste screen real estate
- **Vertical rhythm**: Tall, scrollable, theatrical
- **Touch targets**: 44px minimum for all interactive elements
- **Reduced parallax**: 2-3 layers max on mobile (performance)

### Typography for Mobile

| Element | Desktop | Mobile |
|---------|---------|--------|
| H1 | 72px | 40px |
| H2 | 48px | 32px |
| Body | 20px / 1.7 | 18px / 1.6 |
| Quote | 28px | 22px |
| Caption | 14px | 12px |

### Touch Interactions

- Scroll-lock skip: Visible "Continue ↓" button, 48px touch target
- Image zoom: Optional pinch-to-zoom on archival photos
- Quote sharing: Tap-to-share on key quotes

### Performance Budget (Mobile)

- Initial load: < 3s on 3G
- Largest contentful paint: < 2.5s
- Cumulative layout shift: < 0.1
- Image optimization: WebP with JPEG fallback, lazy loading

---

## Accessibility Requirements

### Reduced Motion

When `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`:
- Disable parallax (flatten to single layer)
- Replace scroll-lock with standard scroll
- Reduce transition durations to 200ms max
- Maintain content, remove animation
- Keep progress bar, simplify to static fill

### Screen Reader Support

- All images have descriptive alt text including era and source
- Example: "Charlie Parker playing alto saxophone, close-up portrait, 1947. William P. Gottlieb Collection, Library of Congress."
- Semantic heading structure (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Skip links for scroll-locked sections
- ARIA labels for interactive elements

### Color Contrast

| Pairing | Ratio | Requirement |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Cream text on Night bg | 14.5:1 | ✅ AAA |
| Silver text on Night bg | 7.2:1 | ✅ AAA |
| Brass on Night bg | 8.4:1 | ✅ AAA |
| Cream on Blue bg | 9.8:1 | ✅ AAA |

All pairings exceed WCAG AAA requirements (7:1 for normal text).

## Uniqueness Verification

### Comparison to Previous Essays

**NOT Like**:
- **Chip Manufacturing** (silicon-revolution): Cold, technical, blue-dominant, laboratory aesthetic. Jazz is warm, human, gold-dominant, club aesthetic.
- **Thai Cuisine**: Vibrant, saturated, culinary color palette. Jazz is nocturnal, muted, musical.
- **Hip-Hop History**: While also music history, hip-hop is street, bold, graphic. Jazz is club, sophisticated, photographic.

**IS Like**:
- **Similar photorealistic approach** to other history essays
- **BUT**: Unique era-shifting treatment, musical staff progress bar, brass-and-blue palette derived specifically from jazz materials

**Unique Elements**:

| Element | Uniqueness |
|---------|------------|
| Color palette | Derived from brass instruments and Blue Note aesthetic—no other essay uses this combination |
| Progress bar | Musical staff with accumulating notes—could only exist for music essay |
| Era processing | 8 distinct treatments matching jazz evolution—no other essay spans this many eras |
| Typography | Editorial sophistication matching jazz's cultural moment (Down Beat, liner notes) |
| Animation philosophy | "Swing" principle—timing slightly off-beat, breathing rhythm |

**Conclusion**: Visual identity is **unique** and could only exist for a jazz essay. The brass gold, midnight blue, musical staff progress, and era-spanning photo treatment create a distinctive visual language grounded entirely in jazz's material and cultural reality.
