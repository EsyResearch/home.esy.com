   HOW TO WRITE A HOOK — THE COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE OF OPENINGS
   ============================================
   A typography-forward visual essay where the reader literally
   crosses through cognitive thresholds. Type forms doorways.
   No photography — typography IS the illustration.

   Central Metaphor: The Doorway/Threshold
   Based on: Loewenstein (Information Gap), Radvansky (Doorway Effect),
             Classical Rhetoric (Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian)

            What if you understood <em>why</em> hooks work? What if you could see the cognitive
            mechanism that transforms a reader from outsider to insider, from skeptic to listener?
          </p>
          <p>
            That understanding exists. It sits at the intersection of cognitive science,
            classical rhetoric, and writing pedagogy. It begins with a metaphor:
            <strong> the doorway</strong>.
