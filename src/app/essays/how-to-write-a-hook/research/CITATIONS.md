## Key Quotes with Sources

### George Loewenstein
> "Curiosity arises when attention becomes focused on a gap in one's knowledge. Such information gaps produce the feeling of deprivation labeled curiosity."
— Loewenstein (1994), p. 87

### Daniel Kahneman
> "System 2 is mobilized when a question arises for which System 1 does not offer an answer... You can also feel a surge of conscious attention whenever you are surprised."
— Kahneman (2011), *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, p. 24

> "The phrase 'pay attention' is apt: you dispose of a limited budget of attention that you can allocate to activities, and if you try to go beyond your budget, you will fail."
— Kahneman (2011), p. 23

### Walter Kintsch
> "The meaning of a word, sentence or even an entire book isn't inherent to the text. It's a collaboration between literal words and an active reader."
— Kintsch (1998), *Comprehension*, p. 4

### Frederic Bartlett
> "Remembering is not the re-excitation of innumerable fixed, lifeless and fragmentary traces. It is an imaginative reconstruction or construction."
— Bartlett (1932), *Remembering*, p. 213

### Aristotle
> "The Introduction is the beginning of a speech, corresponding to the prologue in poetry and the prelude in flute-music; they are all beginnings, paving the way, as it were, for what follows."
— *Rhetoric*, Book III, Chapter 14 (Roberts trans.)

### Quintilian
> "Care must also be taken to avoid exciting suspicion, and speakers should therefore give no hint of elaboration in the exordium."
— *Institutio Oratoria*, Book IV, Chapter 1

### Donald M. Murray
> "I hear rumors of good pieces of writing that have poor leads or beginnings, but I have not been able to find any from professional writers."
— Murray, "Making Meaning Clear"

### Peter Elbow
> "Writing with voice is writing into which someone has breathed."
— Elbow (1981), *Writing with Power*, p. 287

### Ken Macrorie
> "The biggest lesson is this: tell the truth when you write."
— Macrorie (1970), *Telling Writing*
