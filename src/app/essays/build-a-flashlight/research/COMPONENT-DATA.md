## Valid Configurations

Not all combinations work. Here's the compatibility matrix:

### Battery + LED Compatibility

| Battery | Red (2.0V) | Yellow (2.1V) | Green (2.2V) | Blue (3.2V) | White (3.2V) |
|---------|------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1×AA (1.5V) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| 2×AA (3.0V) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Dim | ⚠️ Dim |
| 3×AA (4.5V) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| CR2032 (3.0V) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Dim | ⚠️ Dim |
| 9V | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Note**: "⚠️ Dim" means the voltage is barely above Vf, so the LED will light but very dimly.

### Minimum Resistor by Configuration

To avoid overcurrent (>30mA), minimum resistor values:

| Battery | Red LED | White LED |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2×AA (3.0V) | 33Ω | ~0Ω (barely works) |
| 3×AA (4.5V) | 82Ω | 43Ω |
| 9V | 230Ω | 193Ω |
