## 1. LED Specifications

### Forward Voltage by Color

LEDs require a minimum voltage (forward voltage, Vf) to emit light. This varies by the semiconductor material used for each color.

| LED Color | Forward Voltage (Vf) | Wavelength | Semiconductor Material |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|------------------------|
| Infrared | 1.1–1.4V | >760nm | GaAs, AlGaAs |
| Red | 1.8–2.2V | 620–645nm | AlGaInP, GaAsP |
| Orange | 2.0–2.2V | 590–620nm | GaAsP, AlGaInP |
| Yellow | 2.0–2.4V | 570–590nm | GaAsP, AlGaInP |
| Green | 2.0–3.5V | 520–570nm | GaP, AlGaInP, InGaN |
| Blue | 3.0–3.5V | 450–500nm | InGaN, SiC |
| White | 3.0–3.5V | Broad spectrum | InGaN + phosphor |
| UV | 3.0–4.0V | <400nm | InGaN, AlGaN |

### Current Ratings

| LED Type | Typical Current | Maximum Current | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Standard 5mm | 20mA | 30mA | Most common hobbyist LED |
| High-brightness 5mm | 20–30mA | 50mA | Increased luminous output |
| Power LED (1W) | 350mA | 500mA | Requires heat sinking |
| Power LED (3W) | 700mA | 1000mA | Significant heat management |

**Key Insight**: Running an LED at higher current increases brightness but decreases lifespan and efficiency. This creates a meaningful tradeoff for the reader.

### Luminous Efficacy

| LED Type | Efficacy (lm/W) | Typical Output |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Red 5mm | 20–40 | 2–5 lumens |
| Green 5mm | 50–80 | 5–10 lumens |
| White 5mm | 80–120 | 3–8 lumens |
| White power (1W) | 100–150 | 80–130 lumens |

**Educational Note**: Efficacy varies by color because human eye sensitivity (photopic response) peaks at green (~555nm). A green LED appears brighter than a red LED at the same power.

## 2. Battery Specifications

### Common Battery Types for Flashlights

| Battery | Nominal Voltage | Capacity | Internal Resistance | Form Factor |
|---------|-----------------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| AA Alkaline | 1.5V | 2000–2800mAh | 150–300mΩ | Cylindrical, 50mm × 14mm |
| AAA Alkaline | 1.5V | 1000–1200mAh | 200–400mΩ | Cylindrical, 44mm × 10mm |
| CR2032 (Coin) | 3.0V | 200–240mAh | 15–25Ω | Disc, 20mm × 3.2mm |
| AA NiMH | 1.2V | 1900–2800mAh | 20–50mΩ | Cylindrical, 50mm × 14mm |
| 18650 Li-ion | 3.7V | 2000–3500mAh | 20–80mΩ | Cylindrical, 65mm × 18mm |

### Voltage Discharge Curves

**Alkaline (AA)**:
- Fresh: 1.5V
- 50% capacity: 1.2V
- End of life: 0.9V
- Discharge is gradual, non-linear

**Lithium Coin (CR2032)**:
- Fresh: 3.0V
- 50% capacity: 2.8V
- End of life: 2.0V
- Relatively flat discharge curve

**Key Insight**: Single AA (1.5V) cannot directly drive a white/blue LED (3.0V+). Options: use 2× AA in series, use a boost converter, or choose a red/yellow LED.

### Runtime Calculation

```
Runtime (hours) = Battery Capacity (mAh) / LED Current (mA)
```

**Example**: 
- Battery: AA alkaline, 2500mAh
- LED current: 20mA
- Runtime: 2500 / 20 = 125 hours (theoretical maximum)

**Real-world factor**: Apply 0.7–0.8 efficiency factor for internal resistance and voltage drop.

## 3. Resistor Specifications

### Purpose in LED Circuit

The resistor limits current to protect the LED from overcurrent damage. Without it, the LED would draw excessive current and burn out.

### Standard Resistor Values (E12 Series)

| Decade | Values |
|--------|--------|
| 10Ω range | 10, 12, 15, 18, 22, 27, 33, 39, 47, 56, 68, 82 |
| 100Ω range | 100, 120, 150, 180, 220, 270, 330, 390, 470, 560, 680, 820 |
| 1kΩ range | 1.0k, 1.2k, 1.5k, 1.8k, 2.2k, 2.7k, 3.3k, 3.9k, 4.7k, 5.6k, 6.8k, 8.2k |

### Power Rating

```
Power (W) = Current² × Resistance = I² × R
```

| Resistor Size | Power Rating | Typical Use |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1/8W | 0.125W | Low-current signal circuits |
| 1/4W | 0.25W | Standard hobbyist, LED circuits |
| 1/2W | 0.5W | Higher current applications |
| 1W | 1.0W | Power circuits |

**Example**: 100Ω resistor with 20mA current
- Power = (0.020)² × 100 = 0.04W
- A 1/4W resistor is sufficient (with margin)

## 4. Switch Types

### Common Switch Types

| Type | Operation | Current Rating | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Slide switch | Stays on/off | 0.3–3A | Simple flashlights |
| Toggle switch | Stays on/off | 1–10A | Robust applications |
| Momentary pushbutton | On while pressed | 0.1–1A | Signaling, testing |
| Latching pushbutton | Click on, click off | 0.5–5A | Modern flashlights |
| Rotary switch | Multiple positions | 0.1–1A | Mode selection |

### Switch Placement Considerations

| Position | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Tail cap | Natural thumb operation, one-hand use | Requires longer wiring |
| Side body | Easy access, shorter wiring | May activate accidentally |
| Head twist | Simple, no extra parts | Two-hand operation |

## 5. Reflector and Optics

### Reflector Types

| Type | Beam Pattern | Efficiency | Use Case |
|------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Smooth parabolic | Tight spot, far throw | 70–85% | Long-range flashlights |
| Orange peel | Moderate spot, smooth beam | 65–80% | General purpose |
| Textured | Wide flood, even distribution | 60–75% | Close-range work |
| TIR lens | Adjustable, very efficient | 85–92% | Modern LED flashlights |

### Beam Angle

| Reflector/Lens | Typical Beam Angle |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Deep smooth reflector | 5–10° (spot) |
| Shallow textured reflector | 30–60° (flood) |
| TIR optic (narrow) | 8–15° |
| TIR optic (wide) | 25–40° |
| Bare LED (no optic) | 100–120° |

**Key Insight**: Reflector choice doesn't change total light output—it redistributes it. A spot beam concentrates lumens into a smaller area (higher lux), while a flood spreads them (lower lux, wider coverage).

## 6. Circuit Fundamentals

### Series Circuit (Flashlight)

```
[Battery +] ──→ [Switch] ──→ [Resistor] ──→ [LED +] ──→ [LED -] ──→ [Battery -]
```

**Current Path**: Current flows from battery positive, through switch (when closed), through resistor (which limits current), through LED (which emits light), and back to battery negative.

### Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (Simplified)

> The sum of voltage drops around a closed loop equals the source voltage.

```
V_battery = V_resistor + V_LED
```

**Example**:
- Battery: 3V (2× AA in series)
- LED (white): 3.2V forward voltage
- Problem: LED won't light (insufficient voltage)

**Solution**: Use single AA with red LED (1.5V > 2.0V Vf) or add third AA.

### Current Calculation

```
I = (V_source - V_LED) / R
```

**Example**:
- Source: 3.0V (CR2032)
- LED: White, Vf = 3.2V
- Result: Negative! Won't work.

**Working example**:
- Source: 4.5V (3× AA)
- LED: White, Vf = 3.2V
- Desired current: 20mA

```
R = (4.5 - 3.2) / 0.020 = 65Ω
```

Nearest standard value: 68Ω
