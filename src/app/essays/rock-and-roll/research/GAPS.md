## Recommendations for Gate 2

### Option A: Proceed to Spec
The research package contains sufficient material for a comprehensive visual essay:
- 100+ sources
- 48+ figures profiled
- 53 timeline events
- 28 glossary terms
- Complete coverage of 6 major domains

The gaps (genre evolution, women, producers) can be addressed during Phase 4 production or noted as expansion areas.

### Option B: Re-run Missing Research
Launch new research agents for:
- Genre Evolution (1970s-1990s)
- Women in Rock
- Producers/Engineers/Photographers
- Venues & Studios

This adds approximately 60-90 minutes to the research phase.

## Gate 2 Recommendation

**Proceed to Gate 2 approval with current package.**

The research is comprehensive enough for spec construction. Any gaps can be addressed by:
1. The Invocation Agent during spec construction
2. The Design Researcher during Phase 4
3. The Image Research Expert during Gate 4.5

The core thesis, narrative arc, key figures, and verified quotes are all in place.
