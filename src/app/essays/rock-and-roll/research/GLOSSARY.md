# Glossary: Rock & Roll Research Package

## Musical Terms

### Backbeat
The emphasis on beats 2 and 4 in a 4/4 measure, rather than the traditional 1 and 3. Drummer Earl Palmer is "correctly identified as the man who put the backbeat in rock 'n' roll." This rhythmic innovation, rooted in African American musical traditions, became rock's defining pulse.

### Boogie-Woogie
A piano-based blues style characterized by a driving left-hand "walking bass" pattern (typically eight-to-the-bar) and improvised right-hand melodies. Emerged from Texas lumber camps in the 1870s, popularized in Chicago in the 1920s-30s. The "Boogie-Woogie Trio" (Meade Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson) brought it to Carnegie Hall in 1938.

### Bo Diddley Beat
A syncopated rhythm pattern (shave-and-a-haircut, two bits) introduced by Bo Diddley on his 1955 self-titled debut. One of rock's most copied rhythms, appearing in songs by the Rolling Stones, U2, George Michael, and countless others. Diddley complained he "never got a dime for it."

### British Blues
A blues-influenced rock music style that developed in the UK in the early 1960s, performed predominantly by white British musicians drawing from American blues artists. Key figures: Alexis Korner, John Mayall, the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds. The movement "gave America back the blues" by reintroducing African American music to white American audiences.

### Chicago Blues
The electrified, urban transformation of Delta blues that developed on Chicago's South Side after the Great Migration. Characterized by amplified guitars, harmonicas through PA systems, and full rhythm sections. Muddy Waters: "When I went into the clubs, the first thing I wanted was an amplifier."

### Cover Version
A new performance or recording of a previously recorded song. In the 1950s, white artists (Pat Boone, Georgia Gibbs) routinely covered Black artists' songs with sanitized arrangements for white audiences, often outselling the originals. This practice exploited segregated radio and retail markets.

### Distortion
The alteration of an audio signal that occurs when amplification exceeds the equipment's clean capacity. In rock, this "flaw" became a feature. First recorded instance: Willie Kizart's broken amplifier on "Rocket 88" (1951), stuffed with newspaper to stop rattling.

### Doo-Wop
A vocal-based R&B style featuring close harmonies, nonsense syllables, and minimal instrumentation, popular from the late 1940s through early 1960s. Developed in African American communities in the Northeast. Influenced by gospel quartets and barbershop harmony.

### Gospel
African American sacred music that blends spirituals, hymns, and blues influences. Rock's direct ancestor through figures like Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Thomas A. Dorsey. Tharpe: "All this new stuff they call Rock and Roll, why I've been playing that for years now."

### Humbucker
A type of electric guitar pickup using two coils to "buck" (cancel) the 60-cycle hum that plagued single-coil pickups. Invented by Seth Lover at Gibson (1955-1957). The PAF ("Patent Applied For") humbucker produced a fatter, warmer tone with more sustain, becoming foundational to blues-rock and hard rock.

## Industry Terms

### Clear Channel (AM Radio)
A broadcast station designation allowing 50,000-watt transmission, reaching vast distances via skywave propagation. WLAC Nashville could reach 28 states and three Canadian provinces at night. These stations broke down regional barriers, spreading R&B across the segregated South.

### Crossover
A record or artist that achieves success across multiple charts (typically R&B to Pop, or vice versa). Chuck Berry's "Maybellene" (1955) was an early crossover hit: #1 R&B, #5 Pop. Crossover success often required white artists covering Black originals in the segregated 1950s market.

### Jukebox
A coin-operated phonograph, typically found in bars, diners, and dance halls. Derived from African American "juke joints." By the mid-1940s, three-quarters of all records produced in America went into jukeboxes. The machine shaped rock's format: songs needed to be short, punchy, and attention-grabbing.

### Payola
The illegal practice of paying for radio airplay without disclosure. The 1959-1960 scandal destroyed Alan Freed's career while Dick Clark survived by divesting his holdings. The term combines "pay" and "Victrola" (early record player brand).

### Race Records
Industry term (1922-1949) for recordings by African American artists marketed to African American audiences. Created by Okeh Records' Ralph Peer. Replaced by "Rhythm and Blues" in 1949 after Jerry Wexler proposed the change.
**Source:** History.com, Britannica

### Slapback Echo
A tape-delay effect (134-137 milliseconds) pioneered by Sam Phillips at Sun Studio using two Ampex 350 recorders. Created the distinctive "Sun Sound" on Elvis, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis recordings. When Elvis moved to RCA, engineers had to create a makeshift echo chamber to approximate it.

### Wall of Sound
Production technique developed by Phil Spector at Gold Star Studios (1958-1966). Used multiple instruments playing the same parts (3-4 pianos, multiple guitars), run through cement-lined echo chambers, creating a dense, reverberant wash. Established the producer as auteur.

## Cultural Terms

### British Invasion
The explosion of British rock acts (led by the Beatles) in the American market beginning February 1964. The movement "internationalized the production of rock and roll" and created a transatlantic dialogue that drove rock's rapid evolution through the 1960s.
**Source:** Britannica, academic sources

### Counterculture
The 1960s movement of youth rebellion against mainstream values, closely associated with rock music. Rock became the "international language of youth rebellion," embodying and serving as vehicle for social movements regarding race, sex, and drugs.
**Source:** Britannica, academic sources

### Integration (Concerts)
The gradual breaking down of racial segregation at rock concerts through the 1950s-60s. Early shows featured physical ropes dividing audiences. "Then, hell, the rope would come down, and they'd all be dancing together." — Ralph Bass, Chess Records

### Krautrock
German experimental rock of the late 1960s-70s, characterized by hypnotic rhythms, electronic experimentation, and minimalism. Developed as a rejection of both American cultural dominance and conservative German culture. Influenced punk, post-punk, and electronic music globally.

### Moral Panic
The organized cultural backlash against rock and roll in the 1950s, driven by fears of racial integration and youth rebellion. The White Citizens' Council called rock "a means of pulling down the white man to the level of the Negro."
**Source:** University of Southern Indiana, SUNY SOAR

### Tropicalia
Brazilian avant-garde movement (1967-1969) that fused psychedelic rock with traditional Brazilian music. Led by Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, suppressed by military dictatorship. "The violent aspect of rock 'n' roll interested us more because we were seeing violence."

### Hamburg (Rock History)
German port city where British bands (especially the Beatles) developed their sound through grueling club residencies (1960-1962). Lennon: "I was born in Liverpool, but I grew up in Hamburg." The Star-Club became Europe's premier rock venue.
