We have Orwell's surveillance state (mass data collection, facial recognition, always-on cameras) combined with Huxley's pleasure principle (infinite entertainment, social media dopamine hits, consumerism). The smartphone embodies both prophecies simultaneously."

It represents how pleasure and chemical happiness can be used as tools of social control—no need for force when people drug themselves into compliance."
