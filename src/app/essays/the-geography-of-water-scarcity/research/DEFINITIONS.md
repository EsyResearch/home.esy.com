# Key Definitions: The Geography of Water Scarcity

## Glossary

### Water Stress
- **Technical definition**: The ratio of total freshwater withdrawals to total renewable freshwater resources in a given area. Expressed as a percentage.
- **Accessible definition**: How much of a region's available water is being used up. If a place uses more than 80% of its water, it's in extreme stress — like a bank account that's almost empty every month.
- **Example**: The Middle East withdraws far more water than rainfall replenishes — water stress >80%.
- **Non-example**: The Amazon basin has enormous rainfall and low demand — water stress <10%.
- **Source**: WRI Aqueduct methodology; FAO AQUASTAT
- **Thresholds**: <10% Low, 10-20% Low-Medium, 20-40% Medium-High, 40-80% High, >80% Extremely High (WRI)

### Water Scarcity
- **Technical definition**: The point at which the aggregate impact of all users impinges on the supply or quality of water under prevailing institutional arrangements, to the extent that demand by all sectors cannot be fully satisfied (UN Water, 2007).
- **Accessible definition**: When there isn't enough clean, accessible water to meet a region's needs — for drinking, farming, and industry combined.
- **Example**: Cape Town's "Day Zero" crisis in 2018, when the city nearly ran out of municipal water.
- **Non-example**: A drought in a sparsely populated area with low demand — dry, but not scarce.

### Freshwater
- **Technical definition**: Naturally occurring water with a low concentration of dissolved salts and other dissolved solids (<500 ppm TDS). Includes surface water and groundwater.
- **Accessible definition**: The water we can actually use — rivers, lakes, underground reserves. Only about 2.5% of Earth's water is fresh, and most of that is locked in ice.
- **Example**: The Colorado River, Lake Baikal, the Ogallala Aquifer
- **Non-example**: Ocean water (97.5% of all water), which is too salty to drink or irrigate without desalination

### Water Withdrawal
- **Technical definition**: The total volume of water removed from a source (river, lake, aquifer) for human use.
- **Accessible definition**: How much water we take out of nature for agriculture, factories, and homes.
- **Example**: Egypt withdraws ~68 billion cubic meters/year, mostly from the Nile
- **Non-example**: Water that evaporates or flows out to sea without being captured — that's not withdrawal
- **Source**: FAO AQUASTAT

### Virtual Water
- **Technical definition**: The total volume of water used to produce a commodity, measured throughout the full supply chain.
- **Accessible definition**: The hidden water in everything we buy. A single kilogram of beef requires ~15,400 liters of water (for feed, drinking, processing).
- **Example**: When a water-stressed country imports grain, it's effectively importing the water used to grow it
- **Non-example**: Water you see in a product (like a bottle of water) — virtual water is the water you DON'T see
- **Source**: Water Footprint Network; Hoekstra & Mekonnen, 2012

### Desalination
- **Technical definition**: The process of removing dissolved salts and minerals from saline water to produce freshwater, typically via reverse osmosis or thermal distillation.
- **Accessible definition**: Turning seawater into drinking water — energy-intensive and expensive, but a crucial tool for water-poor countries near coastlines.
- **Example**: Israel produces ~585 million cubic meters/year via desalination (>50% of domestic supply)
- **Non-example**: Water purification (removing contaminants from freshwater) — desalination specifically addresses salt
- **Source**: International Desalination Association

### Water Recycling (Reclamation)
- **Technical definition**: The process of treating wastewater to make it suitable for reuse, including for agriculture, industry, and in some cases potable supply.
- **Accessible definition**: Cleaning used water so it can be used again — from toilets back to taps, or from factories back to farms.
- **Example**: Israel recycles approximately 85% of its wastewater for agricultural irrigation — the highest rate in the world
- **Non-example**: Simple filtration of relatively clean rainwater — recycling specifically means treating wastewater
- **Source**: Israel Water Authority; World Bank

### Baseline Water Stress
- **Technical definition**: WRI Aqueduct's primary indicator, measuring total annual water withdrawals (municipal, industrial, and agricultural) expressed as a percentage of total annual available blue water.
- **Accessible definition**: The standard measure of how much water a region uses relative to what nature provides each year.
- **Source**: WRI Aqueduct 4.0 methodology

## Terms to Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead | Reason |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| "Water crisis" (as general label) | "Water stress" or "water scarcity" | "Crisis" implies acute event; scarcity is chronic and structural |
| "Running out of water" | "Demand exceeding supply" | Earth doesn't run out of water — it's a cycle; the problem is access and management |
| "Third world water problem" | "Global water challenge" / name specific regions | Outdated framing; wealthy nations face stress too |
| "Water wars" | "Water competition" or "transboundary tension" | Sensationalist; most water disputes resolve through cooperation |
| "Dry countries" | "Water-stressed regions" | Conflates aridity with scarcity — Singapore is wet but was water-insecure |
