# Verified Claims: The Geography of Water Scarcity

## Claim Verification Log

### Claim 1: "2.3 billion people live in water-stressed countries"
- **Status**: ✅ Verified
- **Source**: UN Water, "World Water Development Report 2023"
- **Source tier**: Tier 1
- **Verification**: Direct from UN WWDR 2023 executive summary. Refers to countries with baseline water stress >25%.
- **Notes**: Some sources cite "2 billion" (UN-Water 2021) or "3.6 billion" (with different stress thresholds). Use 2.3 billion with "approximately" qualifier and cite the specific report.
- **Used in**: Data Ticker, opening prose

### Claim 2: "Agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of global freshwater withdrawals"
- **Status**: ✅ Verified
- **Source**: FAO AQUASTAT; UN Water
- **Source tier**: Tier 1
- **Verification**: Consistent across FAO, UN Water, and World Bank publications. Range: 69-72% depending on year and methodology. Using "approximately 70%" is accurate.
- **Notes**: Varies significantly by region — in South Asia, agriculture may be >90%; in industrialized Europe, closer to 30-40%. The 70% figure is the global aggregate.
- **Used in**: Sankey Diagram, Data Ticker, prose

### Claim 3: "By 2030, global water demand could exceed sustainable supply by 40%"
- **Status**: ⚠️ Verified with caveats
- **Source**: 2030 Water Resources Group (WRG), "Charting Our Water Future" (2009); cited in McKinsey, World Bank, and UN publications
- **Source tier**: Tier 2 (WRG is industry-academic consortium; widely cited but model-dependent)
- **Verification**: This is a projection under a business-as-usual scenario. The 40% figure has been widely cited but represents one modeling scenario. OECD and UN models produce similar ranges (30-50% gap).
- **Notes**: MUST be labeled as a projection, not a certainty. Include qualifier: "under business-as-usual conditions." The exact percentage varies by model, but the direction is consistent across sources.
- **Used in**: Data Ticker, Section 4 (trajectory), prose

### Claim 4: "Israel recycles approximately 85% of its wastewater for agricultural irrigation"
- **Status**: ✅ Verified
- **Source**: Israel Water Authority; Tal (2006), "Seeking Sustainability: Israel's Evolving Water Management Strategy," Science
- **Source tier**: Tier 1 (government agency) / Tier 1 (peer-reviewed)
- **Verification**: Israel's Shafdan wastewater treatment plant alone processes ~140 million m³/year. The 85% figure is cited by Israel Water Authority, OECD, and multiple academic sources. By comparison, Spain recycles ~12%, the US ~1%.
- **Notes**: This is the essay's most powerful data point for the "policy as lever" argument.
- **Used in**: Country Comparison Widget, Section 5 prose

### Claim 5: "Only 2.5% of Earth's water is freshwater, and less than 1% is accessible for human use"
- **Status**: ✅ Verified
- **Source**: USGS Water Science School; Gleick (1993), "Water in Crisis"
- **Source tier**: Tier 1
- **Verification**: Standard figure in hydrology. 2.5% freshwater (97.5% saline). Of that 2.5%, ~69% is locked in glaciers/ice caps, ~30% is groundwater, ~1% is surface water (lakes, rivers, swamps).
- **Notes**: Technically, accessible groundwater exists but varies hugely. The <1% figure refers to easily accessible surface freshwater.
- **Used in**: Opening context, prose

### Claim 6: "The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is the most water-stressed region, home to 6% of the world's population but only 1% of its freshwater"
- **Status**: ✅ Verified
- **Source**: World Bank, "Beyond Scarcity: Water Security in the Middle East and North Africa" (2018)
- **Source tier**: Tier 1
- **Verification**: Direct from World Bank flagship report. The 6%/1% disparity is a standard reference point.
- **Notes**: Good opening disorientation stat — challenges the assumption that scarcity is just about rainfall.
- **Used in**: Choropleth Map context, prose

### Claim 7: "Singapore imports approximately 40% of its water from Malaysia via pipeline"
- **Status**: ✅ Verified
- **Source**: PUB (Singapore's National Water Agency); Tortajada (2006), "Water Management in Singapore," Water Resources Development
- **Source tier**: Tier 1 (government) / Tier 1 (peer-reviewed)
- **Verification**: Two bilateral water agreements (1961, 1962) with Malaysia. Singapore has invested heavily in NEWater (reclaimed water) and desalination to reduce this dependency. The 40% figure represents current dependence.
- **Notes**: Singapore is the perfect counterexample to "wet = water-secure." Despite 2,400mm annual rainfall, high population density made it water-insecure.

### Claim 8: "India faces the most severe water crisis in its history, with 600 million people facing high to extreme water stress"
- **Status**: ✅ Verified
- **Source**: NITI Aayog, "Composite Water Management Index" (2018); World Bank
- **Source tier**: Tier 1 (Indian government think tank)
- **Verification**: NITI Aayog's 2018 report warned that 21 major Indian cities would run out of groundwater by 2020 and 40% of the population would have no access to drinking water by 2030. While some specific predictions were overly dire, the 600 million figure is corroborated by WRI and World Bank data.
- **Notes**: Use carefully — India's water situation is complex and improving in some areas while worsening in others. Don't present as uniform crisis.
- **Used in**: Choropleth Map hover detail, prose

### Claim 9: "A kilogram of beef requires approximately 15,400 liters of water to produce"
- **Status**: ✅ Verified
- **Source**: Mekonnen & Hoekstra (2012), "A Global Assessment of the Water Footprint of Farm Animal Products," Ecosystems
- **Source tier**: Tier 1 (peer-reviewed)
- **Verification**: Widely cited figure from the Water Footprint Network. Includes feed crop irrigation, drinking water, and processing. Range: 15,000-15,500 L/kg depending on methodology.
- **Notes**: Useful for making agricultural water demand concrete. Compare with: wheat = ~1,800 L/kg, rice = ~2,500 L/kg.
- **Used in**: Section 3 prose (making agriculture's 70% share tangible)

### Claim 10: "Cape Town nearly became the first major city to run out of water in 2018"
- **Status**: ✅ Verified
- **Source**: Numerous Tier 1-2 sources; City of Cape Town official records; Ziervogel (2019), ""; Parks et al. (2019), Nature Sustainability
- **Source tier**: Tier 1-2
- **Verification**: "Day Zero" was projected for April 2018. Averted through aggressive demand management (restrictions to 50L/person/day), some rainfall recovery, and agricultural allocation cuts. Dam levels dropped below 20%.
- **Notes**: Powerful narrative moment — a wealthy, modern city on the brink. Demonstrates that scarcity isn't abstract.
- **Used in**: Section 1 or 2 prose (disorientation — "this happened in a G20 nation")

### Claim 11: "Groundwater depletion in India's Punjab region exceeds natural recharge by an estimated 20+ km³/year"
- **Status**: ⚠️ Verified with caveats
- **Source**: Rodell et al. (2009), Nature; NASA GRACE satellite data
- **Source tier**: Tier 1 (peer-reviewed, satellite-verified)
- **Verification**: NASA's GRACE satellite mission measured groundwater loss in northwestern India from 2002-2008. The depletion rate is significant and ongoing. Exact annual figures vary by study period.
- **Notes**: Good for illustrating "invisible scarcity" — groundwater depletion isn't visible like a dry river.
- **Used in**: Section 4 prose (scarcity equation — invisible demand)

### Claim 12: "Jordan is one of the most water-scarce countries in the world, with less than 100 cubic meters per capita per year"
- **Status**: ✅ Verified
- **Source**: World Bank; Jordan Ministry of Water and Irrigation; UN Water
- **Source tier**: Tier 1
- **Verification**: Jordan's per capita renewable freshwater is approximately 80-100 m³/year, compared to the global average of ~6,000 m³/year and the "absolute scarcity" threshold of 500 m³/year. Consistently cited as among the 3-5 most water-scarce countries globally.
- **Notes**: Critical for the Israel/Jordan comparison — similar geography, radically different outcomes.
