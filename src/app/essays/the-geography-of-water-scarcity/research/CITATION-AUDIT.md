## Claim Inventory

### Core Claims (Require Tier 1-2)

| # | Claim | Section | Inline Citation | Source Tier | Status |
|---|-------|---------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | 2.3 billion people live in water-stressed countries | Data Ticker, Section 1 | — (data element) | 1 (UN WWDR 2023) | ✅ |
| 2 | Agriculture accounts for ~70% of global freshwater withdrawals | Section 3 | `[FAO AQUASTAT]` | 1 (FAO) | ✅ |
| 3 | By 2030, demand could exceed supply by 40% | Section 4 | `[2030 Water Resources Group]` | 2 (WRG consortium) | ✅ w/ caveat |
| 4 | Israel recycles ~85% of wastewater | Section 5 | `[Israel Water Authority, 2022]` | 1 (government) | ✅ |
| 5 | Only 2.5% of Earth's water is freshwater | Section 4 | `[USGS]` | 1 (USGS) | ✅ |
| 6 | MENA: 6% of population, 1% of freshwater | Section 2 | `[World Bank, 2018]` | 1 (World Bank) | ✅ |
| 7 | Singapore imports ~40% of water from Malaysia | Section 5 | `[PUB Singapore]` | 1 (government) | ✅ |
| 8 | India: 600 million face high-extreme water stress | Section 2, 4 | `[NITI Aayog, 2018]` (×2) | 1 (government) | ✅ |
| 9 | 1 kg beef requires ~15,400 L of water | Section 3 | `[Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2012]` | 1 (peer-reviewed) | ✅ |
| 10 | Cape Town nearly ran out of water in 2018 | Section 1 | — (narrative) | 1-2 (City + academic) | ✅ |
| 11 | Punjab groundwater depletion >20 km³/year | Section 4 | — (narrative) | 1 (NASA/Nature) | ⚠️ No inline cite |
| 12 | Jordan: <100 m³ per capita per year | — (Country Comparison data) | — (data element) | 1 (World Bank) | ✅ |

### Claim 3 Caveat
The 40% demand-supply gap projection is properly labeled as a projection ("could exceed," "under business-as-usual projections"). Source is Tier 2 (industry-academic consortium) but widely cited by World Bank, OECD, and UN. Acceptable.

### Claim 11 Note
Punjab groundwater depletion is stated in narrative prose but lacks an inline `ws-cite` span. The source (Rodell et al. 2009, NASA GRACE) is documented in CLAIMS.md but not cited inline. Minor gap — this is a supporting detail, not a headline statistic.

## Quotes

| # | Quote | Attributed To | Source | Verified? |
|---|-------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | "The water crisis is not about having too little water..." | Peter Gleick, Pacific Institute | Gleick, "The World's Water" | ✅ Verified — widely cited, consistent with published works |
| 2 | "We never really valued water as the foundation of life that it is." | Sandra Postel, Global Water Policy Project | Postel, "Last Oasis" (1997) | ✅ Verified — from published monograph |
| 3 | "Water scarcity is not a sentence handed down by geography..." | Editorial (pull quote) | N/A — essay editorial synthesis | ✅ Not attributed to external source — correctly presented without quotation attribution |

**Note**: The Ismail Serageldin quote ("wars of the 21st century will be fought over water") is documented in CLAIMS.md as a potential quote but was NOT included in the essay. This is the correct decision — the quote is often misattributed and the essay notes in CLAIMS.md to use with caution.

## Link Integrity

The essay does not include hyperlinks in the bibliography — sources are listed as text entries. This is consistent with the Esy visual essay format where the Sources section uses text references rather than clickable URLs.

**URLs in research files** (CLAIMS.md, DATASETS.md) reference:
- https://www.wri.org/aqueduct — WRI Aqueduct
- https://www.fao.org/aquastat/ — FAO AQUASTAT
- https://washdata.org/ — WHO/UNICEF JMP
- https://data.worldbank.org/ — World Bank
- https://www.gov.il/en/departments/iwa — Israel Water Authority
- https://www.pub.gov.sg/ — PUB Singapore

These are all stable institutional URLs. Full link health verification deferred to browser-based audit (not conducted in this pass).

## Gap Analysis

### 🟡 Important Issues (Should Fix)

#### Issue 1: Punjab Groundwater — Missing Inline Citation
- **Category**: Claim-Citation
- **Location**: Section 4, paragraph 2 — "extraction exceeds recharge by more than 20 cubic kilometers annually"
- **Description**: This claim is sourced in CLAIMS.md (Rodell et al. 2009, NASA GRACE) but lacks an inline `ws-cite` span in the essay.
- **Recommended Fix**: Add `<span className="ws-cite" title="Rodell et al., Nature 2009"> [Rodell et al., 2009]</span>` after the claim
- **Severity**: 🟡 Important (the source is documented in research, just not surfaced inline)

### 🟢 Polish Suggestions (Nice to Have)

#### Suggestion 1: Add Academic Sources to Bibliography
- **Description**: 5 academic sources in CLAIMS.md are not in the bibliography (Tal 2006, Tortajada 2006, Rodell 2009, Ziervogel 2019, Parks 2019)
- **Recommended Fix**: Consider adding a "Further Reading" subsection for academic sources
- **Severity**: 🟢 Polish (all claims are already supported by listed institutional sources)

#### Suggestion 2: Serageldin Quote Decision
- **Description**: CLAIMS.md documents the Serageldin "water wars" quote with a caution flag. The essay correctly omitted it.
- **Assessment**: Good editorial judgment — the quote is often misattributed and oversimplifies.

## Positive Findings (What's Working Well)

- ✅ 100% Tier 1-2 sources — no low-quality sources
- ✅ All 12 CLAIMS.md entries used in the essay — zero wasted research
- ✅ Projections properly labeled ("could," "under business-as-usual")
- ✅ Quote attributions verified and consistent
- ✅ Section title follows standard ("Sources & Further Reading")
- ✅ Data Ticker statistics all verified in STATISTICS.md
- ✅ Dataset attributions consistent with DATASETS.md
- ✅ No fabricated claims detected
- ✅ Editorially responsible — Serageldin quote correctly omitted
- ✅ Cape Town "nearly" qualifier used — not presented as having happened

## Auditor Certification

- [x] All core claims have Tier 1-2 support
- [x] All quotes are verified and attributed
- [ ] All links are functional and accessible (deferred — text-based bibliography)
- [x] Source tier distribution meets standards (100% Tier 1-2)
- [x] No Tier 4 sources present
- [x] Citation format is consistent
- [x] Content matches research package (no orphan claims)

**Certification Status**: ✅ **APPROVED**

**Auditor Notes**: This is a well-sourced data journalism essay with excellent claim-to-citation discipline. The single inline citation gap (Punjab groundwater) is a minor polish issue — the claim is supported in the research package and the source is Tier 1. No blocking issues identified. The essay's editorial choices (omitting the Serageldin quote, caveating the 40% projection) demonstrate good judgment. Recommend for G7 progression.
