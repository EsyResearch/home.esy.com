## Director Notes

This is a strong data journalism piece that effectively argues water scarcity is a design problem, not a geographic fate. The 5 interactive visualizations (choropleth map, Sankey flow diagram, scroll-locked scarcity equation, country comparison widget, and data ticker) work together to build a compelling data-driven narrative.

Research quality is excellent — 100% Tier 1-2 sources with proper projection labeling. The essay's editorial choices are sound: the Serageldin "water wars" quote was correctly omitted, statistics are properly caveated, and the narrative maintains scientific precision without sacrificing accessibility.

**Approved for publication** pending OG image generation and `visualEssays.ts` entry.
