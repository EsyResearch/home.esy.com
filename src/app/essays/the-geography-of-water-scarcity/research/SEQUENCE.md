# Learning Sequence: The Geography of Water Scarcity

## Prerequisite Chain

```
Disorientation (water stress is global) → Scale (allocation system) → Mechanism (scarcity equation) → Trajectory (time series) → Agency (policy comparison) → Reframing (design problem)
```

## Section Progression

### Section 1: "Opening — The Number You Didn't Expect"
- **Emotional target**: Disorientation
- **Introduces**: Water stress index (basic), geographic scope of scarcity
- **Assumes**: Reader thinks water scarcity is a "developing world" problem
- **Prepares for**: Understanding that this is global, including wealthy nations
- **Visual element**: Data Ticker (key statistics strip) — count-up animation
- **Key moment**: The statistics land AFTER context-free disorientation, BEFORE the reader has a framework — they hit harder this way

### Section 2: "The Map — Water Stress by Region"
- **Emotional target**: Expansion (grasping scale)
- **Introduces**: Geographic distribution, water stress index in detail, time dimension
- **Assumes**: Reader is now primed to see the scope (from Section 1 disorientation)
- **Prepares for**: Understanding the mechanism (WHY these regions are stressed)
- **Visual element**: Interactive Choropleth Map with time scrubber (2000–2040)
- **Key moment**: Scrubbing from 2000 to 2040 and watching stress intensify — the trajectory becomes visceral

### Section 3: "Where Freshwater Goes — The Allocation System"
- **Emotional target**: Understanding (mechanism)
- **Introduces**: Freshwater allocation system, agriculture's dominance, sector breakdown
- **Assumes**: Reader understands WHERE stress exists (from Section 2)
- **Prepares for**: Understanding the scarcity equation (how demand creates deficit)
- **Visual element**: Animated Proportional Flow Diagram (Sankey)
- **Key moment**: Agriculture's 70% share visually overwhelms — the reader viscerally sees the imbalance

### Section 4: "The Scarcity Equation — How Deficit Emerges"
- **Emotional target**: Deeper understanding (synthesis)
- **Introduces**: The scarcity equation, demand-supply interaction, climate as accelerant
- **Assumes**: Reader understands allocation (from Section 3) and geographic patterns (Section 2)
- **Prepares for**: Understanding that the trajectory is worsening (trajectory) and that choices matter (agency)
- **Visual element**: Scroll-Locked Explainer Sequence (progressive diagram, 4-5 stages)
- **Key moment**: The screen locks, each scroll step adds a layer of demand until deficit appears — the reader BUILDS the problem

### Section 5: "Same Rain, Different Outcomes — The Policy Layer"
- **Emotional target**: Agency (hope through comparison)
- **Introduces**: Infrastructure & policy as levers, country comparison data
- **Assumes**: Reader understands the scarcity equation (from Section 4)
- **Prepares for**: Final reframing (scarcity as design problem)
- **Visual element**: Country Comparison Widget (select two countries, side-by-side animated metrics)
- **Key moment**: Israel vs. Jordan — nearly identical rainfall, radically different water outcomes. Policy did this.

### Section 6: "Reframing — A Design Problem, Not a Fate"
- **Emotional target**: Reframing (reader leaves with agency)
- **Introduces**: Water scarcity as a design problem, levers for change
- **Assumes**: All previous concepts — the reader now has the full picture
- **Prepares for**: Reader's own reflection and engagement
- **Visual element**: Prose-only (with possible callback to choropleth showing which regions are investing vs. not)
- **Key moment**: The thesis restated with full force — now the reader has the data to feel its truth

## Cognitive Load Map

| Section | New Concepts | Complexity | Visualization | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | 1 (water stress) | Low | Data Ticker | Hook — raw impact, no explanation yet |
| 2 | 2 (geographic distribution, time series) | Medium | Choropleth Map | Interactive — reader explores at own pace |
| 3 | 2 (allocation system, agricultural dominance) | Medium | Sankey Diagram | Scroll-triggered progressive build |
| 4 | 3 (scarcity equation, demand drivers, climate) | High | Scroll-Lock Explainer | Highest cognitive load — screen locks to guide |
| 5 | 2 (policy levers, comparison methodology) | Medium | Comparison Widget | Interactive — reader chooses pairs |
| 6 | 1 (reframing / synthesis) | Low | Prose-only | Resolution — low new info, high synthesis |

## Section-Visualization Dependency

| Visualization | Must Appear In/After | Reason |
|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| Data Ticker | Section 1 | Hook — no context needed |
| Choropleth Map | Section 2 | Needs water stress concept from Section 1 |
| Sankey Diagram | Section 3 | Needs geographic context from Section 2 |
| Scroll-Lock Explainer | Section 4 | Needs allocation knowledge from Section 3 |
| Comparison Widget | Section 5 | Needs scarcity equation from Section 4 |
