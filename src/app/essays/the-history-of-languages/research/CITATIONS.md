## Research Methodology

Language counts and classification verified through Ethnologue database (editions 24-27, 2017-2024). Endangerment statistics from UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger. Linguistic theory and analysis cross-referenced with Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language and academic works by John McWhorter. Typological data verified through WALS Online and Glottolog 4.0 databases. Writing system information from Omniglot and Unicode standards documentation.

All statistical claims represent current consensus from academic linguistics sources as of 2024.
