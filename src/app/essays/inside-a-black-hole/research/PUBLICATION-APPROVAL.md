# G9 Publication Approval: Inside a Black Hole

## Decision: ✅ APPROVED FOR PUBLICATION

---

## Director's Review

### Certification Basis

All 12 prior gates passed without blocking issues:

- **Research**: 22 sources, 18 verified claims, 91% Tier-1 coverage
- **Design**: Subject-derived visual system (EHT gold, lensing blue, quantum violet), no generic patterns
- **Content**: 9 sections covering observational evidence through philosophical implications
- **Citations**: 100% claim-to-source traceability, 0 fabricated references
- **Scroll**: 98.6% certification score, performant implementation
- **Publication Certification**: GO — no blockers

### Editorial Assessment

**Strengths**:
1. The essay successfully translates graduate-level physics (Penrose diagrams, Schwarzschild metric, information paradox) into accessible prose without oversimplification
2. The second-person narrative ("You cross the event horizon") creates genuine experiential immersion
3. The six SVG visualizations are all pedagogically purposeful — none are decorative
4. The progressive concept layering mirrors the physical experience of falling inward
5. The closing section connects physics to philosophy without overreaching

**Minor notes for future iteration**:
- Interactive Penrose diagram needs `tabIndex` + keyboard handler (flagged in G7)
- Consider adding estimated reading time to hero
