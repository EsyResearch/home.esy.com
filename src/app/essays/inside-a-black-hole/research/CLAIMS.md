## Core Claims

### C1: The Event Horizon Is Not a Physical Surface
**Claim**: The event horizon is a mathematical boundary, not a physical barrier. An infalling observer would not notice anything special when crossing it — no wall, no membrane, no sensation.
**Source**: Thorne, K. (1994). *Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy*. W.W. Norton. Ch. 3.
**Source**: Misner, C., Thorne, K., Wheeler, J. (1973). *Gravitation*. W.H. Freeman. §31-33.
**Tier**: 1 (textbook, peer-reviewed)
**Status**: ✅ Verified — consensus in general relativity

### C2: Time Dilation Becomes Infinite at the Event Horizon (External Observer)
**Claim**: For a distant observer, an object falling into a black hole appears to slow down, redshift, and freeze at the event horizon. The infalling observer experiences no such freeze — they fall through in finite proper time.
**Source**: Schwarzschild, K. (1916). "Über das Gravitationsfeld eines Massenpunktes nach der Einsteinschen Theorie." *Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften*. 189–196.
**Source**: Carroll, S. (2004). *Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity*. Addison-Wesley. Ch. 5.
**Tier**: 1 (foundational paper + textbook)
**Status**: ✅ Verified — direct consequence of Schwarzschild metric

### C3: Spaghettification Is Real but Depends on Black Hole Mass
**Claim**: Tidal forces stretch infalling objects vertically and compress them horizontally. For stellar-mass black holes, this begins well outside the event horizon and is lethal. For supermassive black holes (like M87* or Sagittarius A*), an astronaut could cross the event horizon without noticeable tidal effects.
**Source**: Thorne, K. (1994). *Black Holes and Time Warps*. Ch. 2 & 7.
**Source**: Hamilton, A. (2021). "Journey into a Schwarzschild black hole." JILA, University of Colorado. [Visualization series]
**Tier**: 1-2 (textbook + academic visualization)
**Status**: ✅ Verified — tidal force scales as 1/M² at the horizon

### C4: The Singularity Is a Moment in Time, Not a Place in Space
**Claim**: Inside a black hole, the roles of space and time swap. The singularity is not a point in space you travel toward — it is a moment in your future that you cannot avoid, like next Tuesday.
**Source**: Penrose, R. (1965). "Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities." *Physical Review Letters* 14(3), 57–59.
**Source**: Misner, Thorne, Wheeler (1973). *Gravitation*. §31.4.
**Source**: Carroll, S. (2004). *Spacetime and Geometry*. Ch. 5.7.
**Tier**: 1 (Nobel Prize-winning paper + textbooks)
**Status**: ✅ Verified — consequence of Penrose's singularity theorem

### C5: Penrose Diagrams Map Infinite Spacetime onto a Finite Sheet
**Claim**: A Penrose (conformal) diagram uses coordinate transformations to represent the entire causal structure of spacetime on a finite 2D diamond. Light always travels at 45° angles, making it visually obvious what events can influence what.
**Source**: Penrose, R. (1963). "Asymptotic properties of fields and space-times." *Physical Review Letters* 10(2), 66–68.
**Source**: Hawking, S. & Ellis, G. (1973). *The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time*. Cambridge University Press. Ch. 5.
**Tier**: 1 (foundational papers + monograph)
**Status**: ✅ Verified — standard tool in GR pedagogy

### C6: Gravitational Lensing Is Directly Observed and Confirmed
**Claim**: Black holes bend light from background sources, creating Einstein rings, multiple images, and extreme magnification. This has been directly imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope.
**Source**: Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (2019). "First M87 Event Horizon Telescope Results. I. The Shadow of the Supermassive Black Hole." *The Astrophysical Journal Letters* 875(1), L1.
**Source**: Einstein, A. (1936). "Lens-Like Action of a Star by the Deviation of Light in the Gravitational Field." *Science* 84(2188), 506–507.
**Tier**: 1 (direct observation + Einstein's original)
**Status**: ✅ Verified — EHT image confirms predicted shadow geometry

### C7: Hawking Radiation Means Black Holes Eventually Evaporate
**Claim**: Quantum effects near the event horizon cause black holes to emit thermal radiation and slowly lose mass. A stellar-mass black hole would take ~10⁶⁷ years to fully evaporate — far longer than the current age of the universe (~1.4 × 10¹⁰ years).
**Source**: Hawking, S. (1975). "Particle Creation by Black Holes." *Communications in Mathematical Physics* 43(3), 199–220.
**Source**: Page, D. (1976). "Particle emission rates from a black hole." *Physical Review D* 13(2), 198.
**Tier**: 1 (seminal theoretical papers)
**Status**: ✅ Verified theoretically — not yet observed (radiation is extremely faint for astrophysical black holes)

### C8: The Information Paradox Is the Central Unsolved Problem
**Claim**: If black holes evaporate completely via Hawking radiation, and that radiation is purely thermal (random), then the information about everything that fell in is destroyed. This violates quantum mechanics' unitarity principle (information is never truly lost). This contradiction has been debated for 50 years and remains unresolved.
**Source**: Hawking, S. (1976). "Breakdown of predictability in gravitational collapse." *Physical Review D* 14(10), 2460.
**Source**: Susskind, L. (2008). *The Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics*. Little, Brown.

**Tier**: 1 (foundational theoretical papers)
**Status**: ✅ Verified as an open problem — multiple competing resolutions proposed, none confirmed

### C9: The Firewall Paradox Sharpened the Information Problem
**Claim**: In 2012, Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski, and Sully (AMPS) argued that three individually reasonable assumptions about black holes are mutually contradictory: (1) Hawking radiation is pure (unitarity), (2) the event horizon is uneventful for infalling observers, (3) local quantum field theory is valid outside the horizon. At least one must be wrong. If (2) is wrong, there's a "firewall" of high-energy particles at the horizon.

**Source**: Susskind, L. (2013). "Black Hole Complementarity and the Harlow-Hayden Conjecture." arXiv:1301.4505.
**Tier**: 1 (peer-reviewed)
**Status**: ✅ Verified as a valid paradox — active research area

### C10: Black Hole Complementarity Proposes No Contradiction Exists
**Claim**: Susskind, Thorlacius, and Uglum proposed that information is both reflected at the horizon (from an outside observer's perspective) and passes through (from the infalling observer's perspective). No single observer sees a contradiction because the two views can never be compared by one physical experiment.
**Source**: Susskind, L., Thorlacius, L., Uglum, J. (1993). "The Stretched Horizon and Black Hole Complementarity." *Physical Review D* 48(8), 3743.
**Source**: Susskind, L. (2008). *The Black Hole War*. Ch. 20-22.
**Tier**: 1 (peer-reviewed + popular science)
**Status**: ✅ Verified as a proposed resolution — challenged by AMPS firewall argument

### C11: The Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy Formula Links Area to Information
**Claim**: The entropy (information content) of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon divided by four, in Planck units: S = A/(4ℓ_P²). This is the largest entropy any region of space can have, and it suggests information is encoded on the 2D surface, not in the 3D volume.
**Source**: Bekenstein, J. (1973). "Black Holes and Entropy." *Physical Review D* 7(8), 2333.
**Source**: Hawking, S. (1975). "Particle Creation by Black Holes." *Comm. Math. Phys.* 43(3), 199–220.
**Source**: 't Hooft, G. (1993). "Dimensional Reduction in Quantum Gravity." arXiv:gr-qc/9310026.
**Tier**: 1 (foundational)
**Status**: ✅ Verified — foundational result of quantum gravity

### C12: The Holographic Principle Suggests the Universe May Work Like a Black Hole
**Claim**: The Bekenstein-Hawking formula inspired the holographic principle — the idea that all information in any volume of space can be described by a theory on its boundary. The AdS/CFT correspondence (Maldacena, 1997) provides a concrete mathematical realization.
**Source**: Maldacena, J. (1999). "The Large N Limit of Superconformal Field Theories and Supergravity." *International Journal of Theoretical Physics* 38(4), 1113–1133.
**Source**: Bousso, R. (2002). "The Holographic Principle." *Reviews of Modern Physics* 74(3), 825.
**Tier**: 1 (peer-reviewed, highly cited)
**Status**: ✅ Verified mathematically in AdS/CFT — applicability to real universe debated

### C13: LIGO Detected Gravitational Waves from Merging Black Holes
**Claim**: On September 14, 2015, LIGO detected gravitational waves from two black holes (~36 and ~29 solar masses) merging 1.3 billion light-years away. The signal matched general relativity's predictions to extraordinary precision.
**Source**: Abbott, B. et al. [LIGO Scientific Collaboration] (2016). "Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger." *Physical Review Letters* 116(6), 061102.
**Tier**: 1 (direct observation, Nobel Prize 2017)
**Status**: ✅ Verified — direct detection

### C14: The EHT Image Shows the Black Hole Shadow, Not the Black Hole Itself
**Claim**: The 2019 EHT image of M87* shows a bright ring of superheated gas (the accretion disk) surrounding a dark central shadow. The shadow is caused by photons that crossed the event horizon and never returned. The image resolution is equivalent to reading a newspaper in New York from Paris.
**Source**: EHT Collaboration (2019). "First M87 Event Horizon Telescope Results. I–VI." *ApJ Letters* 875.
**Source**: Akiyama, K. et al. (2022). "First Sagittarius A* Event Horizon Telescope Results." *ApJ Letters* 930.
**Tier**: 1 (direct observation)
**Status**: ✅ Verified — both M87* and Sgr A* imaged

### C15: Inside the Horizon, All Paths Lead to the Singularity
**Claim**: Once inside the event horizon, every possible trajectory — even turning around and firing rockets at maximum thrust in the opposite direction — leads to the singularity. Attempting to escape actually accelerates your arrival, analogous to how standing still in time is impossible outside a black hole.
**Source**: Misner, Thorne, Wheeler (1973). *Gravitation*. §31.4.
**Source**: Taylor, E. & Wheeler, J. (2000). *Exploring Black Holes: Introduction to General Relativity*. Addison-Wesley.
**Tier**: 1 (textbooks)
**Status**: ✅ Verified — mathematical consequence of the metric

### C16: Quantum Gravity Is Needed to Describe the Singularity
**Claim**: General relativity predicts infinite density and curvature at the singularity, which is physically nonsensical. This signals a breakdown of the theory. A complete theory of quantum gravity (not yet achieved) is needed to describe what actually happens at or near the singularity. Leading candidates include string theory and loop quantum gravity.
**Source**: Penrose, R. (2004). *The Road to Reality*. Jonathan Cape. Ch. 27-28.
**Source**: Rovelli, C. (2004). *Quantum Gravity*. Cambridge University Press.
**Source**: Polchinski, J. (1998). *String Theory, Vol. 1 & 2*. Cambridge University Press.
**Tier**: 1-2 (monographs + textbooks)
**Status**: ✅ Verified — consensus that singularity signals theory breakdown

### C17: The "No Hair" Theorem — Black Holes Are Described by Only Three Numbers
**Claim**: A black hole in equilibrium is completely described by just three externally observable properties: mass, electric charge, and angular momentum. All other information about the matter that formed it is lost behind the horizon. "Black holes have no hair" (Wheeler).
**Source**: Israel, W. (1967). "Event Horizons in Static Vacuum Space-Times." *Physical Review* 164(5), 1776.
**Source**: Carter, B. (1971). "Axisymmetric Black Hole Has Only Two Degrees of Freedom." *Physical Review Letters* 26(6), 331.
**Source**: Misner, Thorne, Wheeler (1973). *Gravitation*. §33.
**Tier**: 1 (foundational theorems)
**Status**: ✅ Verified in classical GR — modifications possible in quantum gravity

### C18: Rotating Black Holes Have an Ergosphere Where Spacetime Itself Is Dragged
**Claim**: A rotating (Kerr) black hole drags spacetime around it so powerfully that within the ergosphere (outside the event horizon), it is impossible to remain stationary — you must co-rotate. Penrose showed you could theoretically extract energy from this region.
**Source**: Kerr, R. (1963). "Gravitational Field of a Spinning Mass as an Example of Algebraically Special Metrics." *Physical Review Letters* 11(5), 237.
**Source**: Penrose, R. (1969). "Gravitational Collapse: The Role of General Relativity." *Rivista del Nuovo Cimento* 1, 252–276.
**Tier**: 1 (foundational)
**Status**: ✅ Verified — Kerr metric is exact solution to Einstein's equations
