# Era Guide — The Bitter History of Chocolate

> Historical period treatments for visual design and narrative voice across the essay's four eras.

---

## Era I: Mesoamerican (1500 BCE – 1500s CE)

### Period Character
- **Civilizations**: Olmec → Maya → Aztec
- **Cacao's Role**: Sacred substance — simultaneously currency, medicine, ceremonial drink, and divine offering
- **Social Context**: Highly stratified; chocolate restricted to elites, warriors, priests
- **Key Aesthetic**: Stone carving, codex illustration, glyph writing, jungle canopy

### Visual Treatment
- **Color Palette**: Jade green, obsidian black, terracotta, cacao brown, maize gold
- **Typography Mood**: Angular, carved, monumental — evocative of stone inscription
- **Texture**: Stone relief, bark paper (amatl), ceramic vessel surfaces
- **Light**: Dappled jungle light, temple fire glow, incense smoke
- **Motion**: Slow, ceremonial, smoke-like — the pace of ritual

### Narrative Voice
- **Tone**: Reverent, unhurried, precise
- **Register**: The voice of an anthropologist who respects what they're describing
- **Key Tension**: This was not "primitive" — it was sophisticated, 3,000 years deep

## Era II: Colonial / European Transformation (1519 – 1828)

### Period Character
- **Context**: Spanish conquest → European courts → chocolate houses
- **Cacao's Role**: Stolen commodity being domesticated by colonial powers; sugar added
- **Social Context**: Aristocratic luxury, political salon culture, emerging mercantilism
- **Key Aesthetic**: Colonial manuscripts, Baroque opulence, silver and gold serving ware

### Visual Treatment
- **Color Palette**: Spanish gold, deep burgundy, parchment cream, ink black, silver
- **Typography Mood**: Elegant, serif, courtly — evocative of royal proclamations and letters
- **Texture**: Velvet, tooled leather, wax seals, manuscript illumination
- **Light**: Candlelight, salon warmth, the golden glow of European wealth
- **Motion**: Flowing, liquid — chocolate poured from height, the theatrical service ritual

### Narrative Voice
- **Tone**: Sharp, aware of irony — the theft disguised as discovery
- **Register**: The voice that names what colonialism actually is
- **Key Tension**: European refinement built on Mesoamerican destruction; sugar as the agent of transformation

## Era III: Industrial Revolution (1828 – 1945)

### Period Character
- **Context**: Van Houten → Fry → Lindt → Hershey; four innovations in 70 years
- **Cacao's Role**: Raw material for mass production; chocolate democratized
- **Social Context**: Victorian capitalism, Quaker reformism, American entrepreneurialism
- **Key Aesthetic**: Patent drawings, factory machinery, advertising posters, company towns

### Visual Treatment
- **Color Palette**: Sepia, industrial brass, chocolate brown, cream, factory smoke gray
- **Typography Mood**: Bold, industrial, poster-like — the confidence of progress
- **Texture**: Cast iron, pressed tin, newspaper print, chocolate molds
- **Light**: Factory daylight through high windows, gas lamp warmth, advertising spotlight
- **Motion**: Mechanical, rhythmic, accelerating — the pace of production lines

### Narrative Voice
- **Tone**: Energetic, marvel-at-progress, but with an undertow of unease
- **Register**: The voice knows that "democratization" has a price that will be paid later
- **Key Tension**: The Quaker paradox — social reformers dependent on colonial raw materials

## Era IV: Modern / Contemporary (1945 – Present)

### Period Character
- **Context**: West African production dominance, child labor exposés, bean-to-bar counter-movement
- **Cacao's Role**: $130B global industry; commodity producing poverty for those who grow it
- **Social Context**: Globalized supply chains, corporate obfuscation, consumer activism
- **Key Aesthetic**: Documentary photography, data visualization, investigative journalism

### Visual Treatment
- **Color Palette**: Harsh daylight white, desaturated documentary tones, then warm amber for bean-to-bar
- **Typography Mood**: Clean, sans-serif, data-driven — the typography of reports and investigations
- **Texture**: Soil, weathered hands, cocoa pods, then clean craft-chocolate packaging
- **Light**: Equatorial sun (West Africa), sterile report lighting, then warm workshop glow
- **Motion**: Two contrasting modes:
  - **Exposé**: Still, confrontational, unflinching
  - **Bean-to-bar**: Slow, careful, hand-crafted

### Narrative Voice
- **Tone**: Unflinching for labor issues; cautiously hopeful for alternatives
- **Register**: Investigative, data-backed, refusing to look away
- **Key Tension**: 20 years of promises broken; the $130B industry vs. $0.78/day farmers
