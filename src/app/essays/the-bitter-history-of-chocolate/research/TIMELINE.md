| Date | Event | Significance | Source |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| ~1500 BCE | Olmec cultivate cacao in lowland Mexico | Earliest known cacao cultivation; residue found on pottery | S6 (Washburn), S12 (McNeil) |
| ~600 BCE | Maya develop chocolate drink rituals | Cacao integrated into religious ceremonies, marriage rites, burial offerings | S1 (Coe & Coe), S12 |
