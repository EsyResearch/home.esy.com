## Project Identification

- **Working Title**: The Bitter History of Chocolate
- **Slug**: `the-bitter-history-of-chocolate`
- **Topic**: The Aztecs drank it bitter and believed it was the blood of gods. The Europeans added sugar and conquered the world with it. Now it's a $130 billion industry built on child labor.
- **Target Directory**: `src/app/essays/the-bitter-history-of-chocolate`
- **Date Initiated**: 2026-02-09
- **Workflow**: Standard Visual Essay (5-movement cinematic structure)

## Scope & Intent

### Narrative Arc (Five Movements)

1. **Invocation** — A cacao pod cracked open in darkness; the bitter, sacred drink of Mesoamerica
2. **Ancestral** — 3,000 years of cacao as currency, medicine, and ritual drink — from Olmec origins through Maya and Aztec sacred traditions; Montezuma's golden goblets
3. **Collision** — Cortés steals cacao from the Aztec court → European courts add sugar and transform it → chocolate houses become political salons → industrialization democratizes it
4. **Modern** — The $130 billion global industry; West African cocoa farms, child labor, the broken promise of ethical sourcing; bean-to-bar movement as counter-narrative
5. **Revelation** — Every chocolate bar is a compressed history of empire, extraction, and transformation — the bitter and the sweet are inseparable

### Target Audience
General curious readers; food-literate adults who eat chocolate but don't know its history; readers interested in colonialism, food systems, and supply chain ethics.

### Visual Treatment
Rich, layered, sensory-first. Mesoamerican codex aesthetics transition through Baroque European opulence into modern documentary-style imagery of cocoa farms. Deep browns, golds, and bitter reds. The visual journey mirrors the transformation of cacao itself.

### Estimated Read Time
15–20 minutes (standard depth)

### Special Requirements
- **Moral complexity**: Present colonial extraction and modern child labor with appropriate gravity — no sanitizing
- **Sensory dimension**: Chocolate is taste, smell, texture — the essay should evoke these through design
- **Cross-cultural scope**: Mesoamerican, Spanish colonial, European industrial, West African modern — each requires distinct visual treatment
- **Named figures**: Montezuma II, Hernán Cortés, Conrad van Houten, Milton Hershey, modern cocoa farmers

---

## Approved Depth Mode

- [x] **Standard** (10–15 primary sources, 5–10 figures, 10+ verified quotes)
- [ ] Quick (5–10 sources)
- [ ] Deep (15–25 sources)

**Rationale**: Standard depth provides sufficient room for the 3,000-year arc while keeping the narrative focused on key collision points. The topic has abundant Tier 1 sources (academic histories, museum archives, investigative journalism).

- 1847: Fry & Sons create first chocolate bar
- 1879: Lindt invents conching
- 1900: Hershey mass-produces chocolate
- 2000s: Exposés on West African child labor
- 2010s: Bean-to-bar movement emerges

### Visual Materials (Layer 4 + 5)
- Requirements:
  - [ ] Archive sources identified (Mesoamerican codices, colonial manuscripts, industrial-era photographs)
  - [ ] Era-appropriate imagery located
  - [ ] Visual treatment feasibility confirmed

**Expected Sources**:
- Wikimedia Commons (codex illustrations, colonial portraits, factory photographs)
- Library of Congress (Hershey archives, advertising history)
- Museum archives (British Museum, Smithsonian — Mesoamerican artifacts)
- Photojournalism archives (modern cocoa farm documentation)

### Quotes (Layer 4)
- Requirements:
  - [ ] Minimum 10 verified quotes with sources
  - [ ] Attribution confirmed for each
  - [ ] Spanning at least 3 eras (ancient, colonial, modern)

### Interaction Modes to Test
From the ideas list, this essay targets:
- **IngredientOracle** — cacao pod → nibs → liquor → butter → bar (tap to reveal transformation)
- **FlavorWheel** — chocolate tasting notes (origin, fermentation, roast profile)
- **MigrationTrail** — Mesoamerica → Spain → Switzerland → West Africa

## Key Research Questions

1. What was the ritual and economic role of cacao in Mesoamerican civilizations?
2. How did the Spanish colonial encounter transform cacao from sacred drink to commodity?
3. What technological innovations (cocoa press, conching, tempering) made chocolate a mass product?
4. What is the documented scale of child labor in modern cocoa production?
5. How does the bean-to-bar movement attempt to address the supply chain's ethical failures?
6. What primary sources document each transformation point?
