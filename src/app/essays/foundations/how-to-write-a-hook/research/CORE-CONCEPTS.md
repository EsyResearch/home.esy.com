## Concepts by Domain

### Cognitive Science

| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---------|------------|--------|
| **Information Gap Theory** | Curiosity arises when attention focuses on a gap in knowledge, creating cognitive "hunger" that motivates information-seeking. Optimal gaps are neither too small (boring) nor too large (overwhelming). | Loewenstein, 1994 |
| **Dual-Process Theory (System 1/2)** | System 1 monitors for novelty automatically; System 2 engages deliberate processing when surprised. Hooks trigger the "surge of conscious attention" from System 1 to System 2. | Kahneman, 2011 |
| **Working Memory Constraints** | Holds ~7 chunks for ~20 seconds. Hooks must work within these limits—simple enough to comprehend instantly, complex enough to create interest. | Miller, 1956 |
| **The Doorway Effect** | Walking through doorways impairs short-term memory because doorways serve as "event boundaries" in the mind. The brain compartmentalizes and prepares for new contexts. | Radvansky & Copeland, 2006 |
| **Event Boundaries** | Cognitive demarcations that segment one mental episode from another. Crossing a threshold triggers a cognitive reset. | Radvansky, 2006 |
| **Schema Activation** | First sentences activate mental frameworks that shape all subsequent interpretation. Wrong schema = mismatched expectations. | Bartlett, 1932 |

### Classical Rhetoric

| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---------|------------|--------|
| **Proem (Prooimion)** | The opening that "paves the way for what follows"—functional, not ornamental. | Aristotle, Rhetoric |
| **Exordium Goals** | Make audience: (1) attentive, (2) receptive, (3) well-disposed (benevolent). | Cicero, De Oratore |
| **Principium vs. Insinuatio** | Direct opening (principium) for receptive audiences; subtle approach (insinuatio) for hostile or indifferent ones. | Cicero |
| **Seven Faults of Openings** | Vulgare (generic), commune (common), commutabile (interchangeable), longum (tedious), separatum (disconnected), translatum (mismatched), contra praecepta (against principles). | Cicero |
| **Visible Artifice Warning** | Speakers "should give no hint of elaboration in the exordium." Technique that calls attention to itself undermines trust. | Quintilian, Institutio Oratoria |

### Writing Pedagogy

| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---------|------------|--------|
| **Hook as Cognitive Threshold** | A hook is not a gimmick—it is the cognitive doorway between the reader's world and the essay's world. | Essay synthesis |
| **Engfish** | Lifeless prose that sounds like what essays "should" sound like rather than genuine thought. Formulaic writing that lacks authentic voice. | Macrorie, 1970 |
| **Hook Discovery vs. Planning** | Good hooks are often discovered through revision, not pre-planned. Write the body first, understand your argument, then return to find the hook. | Murray, various |
| **Authentic Voice** | Emerges from authentic engagement with material. "Writing with voice is writing into which someone has breathed." | Elbow, 1981 |

### Anthropology & Ritual

| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---------|------------|--------|
| **Liminality** | The transitional state between separation and incorporation. From Latin *limen* (threshold). | Van Gennep, 1909 |
| **Rites of Passage Structure** | Three phases: (1) Separation, (2) Liminality, (3) Incorporation. The hook performs the first movement—separating the reader from prior context. | Van Gennep, 1909 |

## Hook Type Taxonomy

| Hook Type | Best For | Mechanism | Risk |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------|
| **Orienting Hook** | Informative essays | Establishes context and significance | May feel dry if not well-executed |
| **Tension Hook** | Argumentative essays | Stakes controversial position early, creates productive disagreement | Must justify bold claim or trust erodes |
| **Question Hook** | Analytical essays | Poses interpretive puzzle the essay will address | Gap may be too large or confusing |
| **Scene Hook** | Narrative essays | Drops reader *in medias res*, uses sensory detail | Schema mismatch if essay pivots to abstraction |

---

## The Four-Question Framework

A practical framework for designing hooks deliberately:

1. **Who is the reader?** — What do they know? What would surprise them?
2. **What context do they lack?** — What must you establish for the essay to make sense?
3. **What expectation must be set?** — What kind of journey are you promising?
4. **What gap should exist after the first sentence?** — What question should linger?

## Key Figures Referenced

| Figure | Contribution | Era |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| Aristotle | Defined proem as functional, not ornamental | 384–322 BCE |
| Cicero | Codified exordium goals; principium vs. insinuatio | 106–43 BCE |
| Quintilian | Warned against visible artifice in openings | 35–100 CE |
| Arnold van Gennep | Introduced liminality in rites of passage | 1873–1957 |
| George Loewenstein | Information Gap Theory | b. 1955 |
| Daniel Kahneman | System 1/System 2 dual-process theory | 1934–2024 |
| Gabriel Radvansky | Doorway effect research | Active 2000s–present |
| Ken Macrorie | Coined "Engfish" for phony prose | 1918–2020 |
| Donald Murray | Hooks discovered, not pre-planned | 1924–2006 |
| Peter Elbow | Authentic voice through authentic engagement | b. 1935 |

## Meta-Concept: The Threshold Metaphor

The essay itself embodies its central thesis: hooks as cognitive thresholds. Each chapter functions as a doorway the reader crosses, with explicit "threshold" language and visual doorway motifs throughout.

**Structural Application:**
- Hero: "Begin." → Doorway "H" → Title → Promise → Insight
- Chapter numbers rendered as typographic doorways
- Progress indicator: Opening door animation
- 8 chapters = 8 thresholds crossed
