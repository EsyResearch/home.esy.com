# Research Package: How to Write a Hook for an Essay

**Date Compiled**: December 19, 2025
**Status**: Complete
**Gate 2**: APPROVED

## Research Overview

This research package provides the cognitive science, rhetorical theory, and visual metaphor foundations for a visual essay that treats hooks as **cognitive mechanisms** rather than tips or formulas.

## Core Finding

**A hook is a cognitive threshold** - a transition point where the reader crosses from their world into the essay's world. Like a doorway, it creates an "event boundary" in the brain, signaling that a new mental episode is beginning.

## Research Sources

### 1. Cognitive Science (`FIGURES.md` - Cognitive Section)
- **George Loewenstein**: Information Gap Theory - curiosity as cognitive deprivation
- **Daniel Kahneman**: System 1/System 2 - attention allocation and surprise
- **Walter Kintsch**: Construction-Integration Model - comprehension as meaning construction
- **Richard Mayer**: Cognitive Load Theory - working memory constraints
- **Daniel Berlyne**: Arousal Theory - novelty, complexity, incongruity
- **Frederic Bartlett**: Schema Theory - how prior knowledge shapes interpretation
- **John Sweller**: Cognitive Load Theory - limited processing capacity

### 2. Rhetoric & Composition (`FIGURES.md` - Rhetoric Section)
- **Aristotle**: Proem as "paving the way" - functional, not decorative
- **Cicero**: Three goals (attentive, receptive, well-disposed) + seven faults
- **Quintilian**: Warning against visible artifice
- **Peter Elbow**: Voice and authentic engagement
- **Donald Murray**: "I know of no good writing with poor leads"
- **Ken Macrorie**: "Engfish" - formulaic hooks as inauthentic prose

### 3. Visual Metaphor (`METAPHORS.md`)
- **Primary Metaphor**: THE DOORWAY/THRESHOLD
- **Cognitive Basis**: Radvansky & Copeland's "doorway effect" research
- **Anthropological Basis**: Van Gennep/Turner liminality theory
- **Secondary Metaphor**: The Lens (for orientation/focus function)

## Key Insights for Visual Essay

1. **Mechanism over Tactics**: Hooks work because humans are prediction machines with limited processing capacity, driven by information gaps, wired to orient toward novelty
2. **The Inverted U-Curve**: Too little information = overwhelming; too much = boring; moderate gap = maximum curiosity
3. **Three Classical Goals**: Make the audience attentive, receptive, and well-disposed (not just "grab attention")
4. **Visible Artifice Problem**: Quintilian warned that technique calling attention to itself undermines trust - applicable to "gimmicky" hooks
5. **Doorway as Transformation**: Unlike bridges (same on both sides) or lenses (focus as destination), doorways capture the transformational crossing moment
