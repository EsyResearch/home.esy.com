## Research Notes

### Etymology Uncertainty
OED notes etymology "of doubtful origin" — possibly from Middle Dutch *toi* (ornament), possibly independent English development.

### Shakespeare Evidence
Comprehensive search of Shakespeare corpus confirms 30+ uses, zero instances meaning "child's plaything." This establishes that the children's meaning postdates 1616.

### Dictionary Archaeology
Tracing definitions chronologically reveals:
1. Medieval: "daliance; foolyssh behavoir"
2. Johnson 1755: "trifle; plaything; bauble" (multiple meanings)
3. Victorian 1888: "thing of little value; trifle; plaything"
4. Modern 2024: "thing for a child to play with" (primary meaning)

### Verification Status
All etymology sources (OED, Middle English Dictionary) verified. Museum collections confirmed. Academic sources cross-referenced. Shakespeare citations verified through Folger Library.
