## Key Facts Verification

### Origins and History
- **1900 BCE**: Mokaya people first cultivate Theobroma cacao (PNAS verification)
- **600 CE**: Maya develop sophisticated cultivation and ceremonial use
- **1400 CE**: Aztec Empire uses cacao as currency
- **Currency values**: 1 bean = 1 tomato; 3 beans = 1 avocado; 100 beans = 1 turkey

### European Expansion
- **1528**: Hernán Cortés brings cacao to Spain
- **1606**: Antonio Carletti introduces chocolate to Italy
- **1657**: First English chocolate house opens in London
- **1828**: Coenraad van Houten invents cocoa press (separates butter from powder)
- **1847**: J.S. Fry & Sons create first modern chocolate bar

### Botanical Facts
- **Theobroma cacao**: "Food of the gods" (scientific name)
- **20 pods per tree per year**: Average yield
- **400 beans per pound**: Required for chocolate production
- **5 years**: Time for tree to bear fruit
- **20° from equator**: Growing zone constraint (the Cocoa Belt)

### Fermentation Process
- **5-7 days**: Fermentation duration
- **25°C to 52°C**: Temperature range during fermentation
- **Day 1**: Yeast consumes sugars, produces alcohol
- **Days 2-3**: Lactic bacteria dominate
- **Days 4-5**: Acetic bacteria, heat peaks at 50°C
- **Days 6-7**: Flavor precursors crystallize

### Global Production (2020-2024 data)
- **Ivory Coast**: 40% of global production
- **Ghana**: 18% of global production
- **Indonesia**: 11% of global production
- **Ecuador**: 5% of global production
- **58% from two countries**: Ivory Coast and Ghana combined

### Corporate Chocolate Empires
- **Mars, Inc.**: $47B revenue (founded 1911)
- **Mondelez**: $36B revenue (founded 1923)
- **Ferrero**: $17B revenue (founded 1946)
- **Nestlé**: $15B chocolate revenue (founded 1866)
- **Hershey**: $11B revenue (founded 1894)
- **Lindt**: $5.5B revenue (founded 1845)
- **Total global market**: $180+ billion

### Ethical and Environmental Statistics
- **1.56 million children**: In cocoa farming in West Africa
- **80%**: Ivory Coast forests lost to cocoa cultivation
- **6%**: Of chocolate price reaches farmers
- **2050**: Projected climate devastation of key growing regions
- **600+ craft chocolate makers**: Worldwide (2023)
- **15% annual growth**: Premium chocolate segment

### Bean-to-Bar Processing
1. **Harvest**: Ripe pods hand-cut, opened within 48 hours
2. **Ferment**: 5-7 days, temperatures reach 50°C
3. **Dry**: 5-14 days, moisture drops from 60% to 7%
4. **Roast**: 20-40 minutes at 120-160°C
5. **Crack**: Shells removed, nibs separated
6. **Grind**: 24-72 hours creates cocoa liquor
7. **Conch**: 12-72 hours refines texture
8. **Temper**: Precise cooling for snap and sheen
