            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Orwell drew from his experiences as a colonial policeman in Burma, fighting fascism in the Spanish Civil War, and working at the BBC during WWII. Stalin's Soviet Union and Nazi Germany provided the totalitarian models. His tuberculosis while writing on the Isle of Jura added urgency to his vision."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The Ministry of Truth was based on Orwell's time at the BBC (1941-1943), where he wrote propaganda for the Eastern Service. The censorship, rewriting of news, and bureaucratic culture he witnessed there directly influenced Minitrue. The BBC's Senate House building inspired the ministry's architecture."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Room 101 was a conference room at BBC Broadcasting House where Orwell attended tedious meetings. He transformed this mundane annoyance into the ultimate torture chamber—the room that contains your worst fear. In 1984, Room 101 is where the Party breaks Winston with his terror of rats."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes, Orwell joined the POUM militia in Spain in 1936 to fight Franco's fascists. He was shot through the throat by a sniper and nearly died. More traumatic was watching the Communist Party purge his fellow socialists—he witnessed how revolutionary movements devour their own, inspiring the Party's betrayals in 1984."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "After his wife Eileen's death in 1945, Orwell retreated to a remote farmhouse on Jura, Scotland. He wrote 1984 while dying of tuberculosis, often typing in bed. The isolation and harsh conditions mirrored the bleakness of Oceania. He finished the manuscript in late 1948 (reversing the year gave '1984')."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Doublethink is holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously and accepting both. Orwell observed this in Stalinist apologetics—intellectuals who defended Soviet purges while knowing they were atrocities. The concept shows how totalitarianism corrupts not just society, but the individual mind's capacity for truth."
