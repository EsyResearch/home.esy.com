## Research Methodology

This essay relies on Robert P. Goldman's critical edition of Valmiki's Ramayana, cross-referenced with Pollock's translations and Richman's comparative studies. Visual sources documented through Metropolitan Museum of Art and Archer's definitive Pahari painting scholarship. Living tradition aspects verified through UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage documentation and Lutgendorf's ethnographic work on contemporary performance traditions.

The essay acknowledges multiple interpretations, the contested status of Uttara Kanda, and presents the narrative as living religious tradition while incorporating scholarly perspectives.
