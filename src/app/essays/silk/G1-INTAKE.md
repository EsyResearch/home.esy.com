## Topic & Scope

**Working Title**: Silk
**Subtitle**: 3,000 Years of Thread, Empire, and Espionage
**Category**: History / Culture
**Estimated Read Time**: 14–16 min

### Core Narrative

For 3,000 years, China guarded one secret: how caterpillars make thread. Empires rose and fell along the road named for it. Silk funded the Tang Dynasty, connected Rome to Xi'an, clothed every emperor and pope, and sparked one of history's greatest acts of industrial espionage — two Byzantine monks smuggling silkworm eggs out of China in hollow bamboo canes.

This is a material-culture origin story that spans the full arc of human civilization: from Neolithic Chinese sericulture to the Jacquard loom that prefigured the computer, to today's $16B global silk industry.

### Visual Treatment

**Photorealistic + archival**. This essay requires extensive photography:
- Silk production photography (mulberry groves, silkworm cultivation, hand-reeling, weaving looms)
- Silk Road landscape photography (Taklamakan desert, Samarkand, Kashgar, caravanserai ruins)
- Museum artifact photography (Han Dynasty silk fragments, Tang court robes, Byzantine textiles, Venetian damask)
- Historical portraiture (Empress Leizu legend depictions, Zhang Qian, Justinian I)
- Modern silk industry (Suzhou silk mills, Italian textile houses, fashion runways)

**Interaction Modes**: MigrationTrail (Silk Road Xi'an→Constantinople), IngredientOracle (mulberry leaf → silkworm → cocoon → thread → fabric), TimefoldSlider (Neolithic → Han → Tang → Byzantine → Jacquard → Modern)

## Key Research Questions

### Ancestral (Origins & Mythology)
1. What are the earliest archaeological evidence of silk production? (Hemudu? Yangshao?)
2. What is the Empress Leizu legend and when did it crystallize?
3. How did sericulture become a state secret — what were the penalties for smuggling?
4. How did silk function in Chinese court ritual, burial, and diplomacy?

### Collision (Transmission & Espionage)
5. How did Zhang Qian's diplomatic missions open the Silk Road?
6. What was the structure of Silk Road trade — who were the intermediaries (Sogdians, Parthians)?
7. What is the full story of the Byzantine silkworm smuggling (Justinian I, the monks, the hollow canes)?
8. How did the Islamic world develop its own silk industries (Damascus, Spain)?
9. How did Italian city-states (Lucca, Venice, Florence) build their silk monopolies?

### Modern Echo
10. How did the Jacquard loom's punch-card system prefigure computing?
11. What is the state of modern silk production (China 80% global share, Indian muga silk)?
12. What role does silk play in modern fashion and textile innovation?
13. What are the ethical dimensions — wild silk vs. cultivated, animal welfare?

### Figures to Research
- **Empress Leizu** (legendary discoverer of silk, ~2700 BCE)
- **Zhang Qian** (Han Dynasty diplomat who opened the Silk Road, 138 BCE)
- **Emperor Wu of Han** (patron of Silk Road expansion)
- **Justinian I** (Byzantine emperor who broke the Chinese monopoly)
- **The two monks** (unnamed Nestorian monks who smuggled silkworm eggs)
- **Joseph Marie Jacquard** (inventor of the programmable loom, 1804)
- **Louis XIV** (patron of Lyon silk industry)
- **Jim Thompson** (American who revived Thai silk industry, 1950s — then vanished)

## 5-Movement Structure (Preliminary)

| Movement | Focus | Scroll % |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **I. Invocation** | A single silk thread catches light. Sensory: the sound of a loom, the shimmer of fabric. No facts — pure texture. | 10% |
| **II. Ancestral** | Neolithic China → Empress Leizu → state secret → Han Dynasty court silk | 25% |
| **III. Collision** | Zhang Qian opens the road → Sogdian traders → Byzantine espionage → Islamic silk → Italian city-states | 30% |
| **IV. Modern Echo** | Jacquard's punch cards → Lyon silk workers → Jim Thompson in Thailand → Suzhou today → fashion | 20% |
| **V. Revelation** | A thread connects every civilization. Return to the shimmer — transformed by 5,000 years of meaning. | 15% |

## Special Requirements

1. **Extensive photography** — this essay should be image-dense, with photorealistic hero images for each movement
2. **MigrationTrail** must trace the actual Silk Road route with named stops (Xi'an, Dunhuang, Kashgar, Samarkand, Baghdad, Constantinople, Venice)
3. **IngredientOracle** should cover the full sericulture process (mulberry cultivation → silkworm rearing → cocoon harvesting → reeling → throwing → weaving → dyeing)
4. **Cross-cultural citation** — sources needed from Chinese, Byzantine, Islamic, and European scholarship
5. **Jim Thompson disappearance** — fascinating modern mystery, should be treated with journalistic rigor

---

## Design Research Direction (Preliminary)

The visual identity should derive from:
- Silk's physical properties: luminosity, drape, translucency, iridescence
- Chinese calligraphic traditions and court aesthetics
- Silk Road cartographic heritage
- The contrast between raw cocoons and finished brocade
