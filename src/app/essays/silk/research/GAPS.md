# Research Gaps — Silk

> Items that could not be fully verified. These MUST NOT appear as claims in the spec.

---

## Gap 1: Identity of the Smuggling Monks
- **Claim to avoid**: Naming the monks or specifying their origin beyond "from India/Central Asia"
- **What we know**: Procopius says monks came "from India" (which in 6th-century usage often meant anywhere east of Persia). They were likely Nestorian Christians.
- **Status**: Present as anonymous figures — their anonymity is part of the story's power.

## Gap 2: Exact Route of Silkworm Smuggling
- **Claim to avoid**: Stating definitively that the eggs came from China proper
- **What we know**: Some scholars suggest Khotan (modern Hetian, Xinjiang) as the more likely source, since it had its own silk tradition by the 5th century.
- **Status**: Present Procopius's account but note scholarly uncertainty.

## Gap 3: Jim Thompson's Fate
- **Claim to avoid**: Endorsing any specific theory of his disappearance
- **What we know**: He walked into the Malaysian jungle on March 26, 1967 and was never seen again. Theories include: accidental death (tiger, fall), abduction by Communist agents, CIA operation, or staged disappearance.
- **Status**: Present as an unsolved mystery. Warren's biography is the authoritative source.

## Gap 4: Exact Economic Scale of Ancient Silk Trade
- **Claim to avoid**: Precise monetary values for ancient Silk Road trade volume
- **What we know**: Pliny estimated Rome's annual trade deficit to Asia at 100 million sesterces, but this figure is debated among economic historians. Hansen (C1) argues most trade was local, not end-to-end.
- **Status**: Use Pliny's figure with attribution ("Pliny estimated...") rather than as objective fact.

## Gap 5: Leizu Legend Historical Basis
- **Claim to avoid**: Presenting Empress Leizu as a historical figure
- **What we know**: The legend appears in later texts; the archaeological record (C5) shows silk use thousands of years before the traditional date. Leizu is a cultural figure, not a verified historical person.
- **Status**: Present clearly as legend/myth, noting it's culturally significant regardless of historicity.

## Gap 6: Modern Labor Conditions
- **Claim to avoid**: Specific accusations about named companies or factories
- **What we know**: Silk production in some regions involves low wages and poor conditions, but comprehensive verified data for a journalistic-level claim is limited in our source set.
- **Status**: Can reference general ethical dimensions without specific claims. Not the focus of this essay.
