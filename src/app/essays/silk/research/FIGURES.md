## Figure 1: Empress Leizu (嫘祖)

- **Period**: c. 2700 BCE (legendary)
- **Role**: Legendary discoverer of silk; wife of the Yellow Emperor
- **Key Contribution**: According to Chinese tradition, Leizu discovered silk when a silkworm cocoon fell into her tea, and she unwound the thread. She is credited with inventing sericulture and the silk loom.
- **Quote**: N/A (legendary figure — narrative attribution from *Records of the Grand Historian*)
- **Imagery**: Temple depictions, traditional paintings of Leizu discovering the cocoon. Leizu temple in Yanting County, Sichuan.
- **Source**: C4 (Needham), C7 (V&A)
- **Notes**: Legendary, but the legend itself is historically significant — it was used for millennia to justify silk as China's civilizational gift. Annual Leizu worship festivals still occur.

## Figure 2: Zhang Qian (張騫)

- **Period**: d. 114 BCE
- **Role**: Han Dynasty diplomat and explorer
- **Key Contribution**: Sent by Emperor Wu to forge alliances against the Xiongnu, Zhang Qian's two missions (138 BCE and 119 BCE) opened the routes that became the Silk Road. He was captured and held for 10 years before completing his first mission.
- **Quote**: "Zhang Qian was the first person to bring back a clear account of [Central Asia]." — Sima Qian, *Records of the Grand Historian*
- **Imagery**: Han Dynasty tomb murals, modern statues in Xi'an, UNESCO World Heritage signage
- **Source**: C1 (Hansen), C8 (LOC)
- **Notes**: The "Great Traveler" (博望侯). His intelligence reports gave the Han court its first real picture of the world beyond China.

## Figure 3: Emperor Wu of Han (漢武帝)

- **Period**: 156–87 BCE
- **Role**: Han Dynasty emperor who aggressively expanded the Silk Road
- **Key Contribution**: Patron of Zhang Qian's missions. Expanded Chinese control over the Hexi Corridor and established the Protectorate of the Western Regions — the military infrastructure that made sustained trade possible.
- **Quote**: N/A (actions documented in *Records of the Grand Historian*)
- **Imagery**: Imperial portraits, Han Dynasty tomb art, Great Wall expansion maps
- **Source**: C1 (Hansen), C8 (LOC)

## Figure 4: Justinian I

- **Period**: 482–565 CE
- **Role**: Byzantine Emperor
- **Key Contribution**: Orchestrated the breaking of China's silk monopoly. According to Procopius, Justinian persuaded two Nestorian monks to smuggle silkworm eggs from China (or Central Asia) to Constantinople in hollow bamboo canes, c. 552 CE. This launched the Byzantine silk industry and ended centuries of Persian middleman exploitation.
- **Quote**: Procopius reports Justinian received the monks "with joy" and that they "returned immediately to deliver the eggs to the emperor." — *History of the Wars*, Book I
- **Imagery**: Famous Justinian mosaic at San Vitale, Ravenna (6th century). Widely available, public domain.
- **Source**: C3 (Procopius), C2 (Prasad)

## Figure 5: The Two Monks (Anonymous Nestorian Monks)

- **Period**: c. 552 CE
- **Role**: Smugglers of silkworm eggs from the East to Byzantium
- **Key Contribution**: Successfully transported silkworm eggs hidden in hollow bamboo staffs from Khotan (or China proper) to Constantinople, breaking the Chinese/Persian monopoly on raw silk production.
- **Quote**: "They said that they were formerly in Serinda [China], and that while they were living there they had learned the whole art of making silk." — Procopius, *History of the Wars*
- **Imagery**: Medieval manuscript illustrations of the smuggling story. Mosaic and textile depictions in Byzantine art.
- **Source**: C3 (Procopius)
- **Notes**: Their names were never recorded. One of history's most consequential anonymous acts.

## Figure 6: Joseph Marie Jacquard

- **Period**: 1752–1834
- **Role**: French weaver and inventor
- **Key Contribution**: Invented the Jacquard loom (1804), which used interchangeable punch cards to automate complex silk weaving patterns. This punch-card system directly inspired Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine and, through it, the entire history of computing.
- **Quote**: "It is the invention which weaves flowered silks, in a style far superior to anything that was done before." — 1812 British government report
- **Imagery**: Portrait by Claude Bonnefond (widely available). Jacquard loom mechanisms in science museums worldwide. Silk self-portrait woven on a Jacquard loom (Musée des Arts et Métiers, Paris).
- **Source**: C15 (Essinger)
- **Notes**: The Jacquard silk self-portrait, woven using 24,000 punch cards, is one of the most remarkable technological artifacts of the 19th century.

## Figure 7: Jim Thompson

- **Period**: 1906–1967 (presumed dead)
- **Role**: American businessman, CIA operative, Thai silk revivalist
- **Key Contribution**: After serving in the OSS during WWII, Thompson settled in Bangkok and single-handedly revived the moribund Thai silk industry. He modernized production while preserving traditional hand-weaving, built an international luxury brand, and transformed Thailand's textile economy. On March 26, 1967, he vanished while on a walk in the Cameron Highlands of Malaysia. His body was never found.
- **Quote**: "Thai silk was dying when I arrived. The weavers were switching to synthetic threads. I simply showed them the world still wanted what they made." — attributed, from William Warren biography
- **Imagery**: Photographs from the Jim Thompson House Museum, Bangkok. Personal photographs (many published).
- **Source**: C11 (Warren)
- **Notes**: The disappearance remains one of Asia's great unsolved mysteries. Theories include tiger attack, Communist abduction, and CIA assassination.

## Figure 8: Louis XIV (The Sun King)

- **Period**: 1638–1715
- **Role**: King of France
- **Key Contribution**: Made Lyon the silk capital of Europe. Louis XIV's mercantilist policies (under Colbert) banned imported silk and invested heavily in French silk production. The Fabrique de Lyon became the world's largest silk manufacturing center, employing over 28,000 workers by 1720.
- **Quote**: Colbert to Louis XIV: "It is simply and solely the abundance of money within a state which makes the difference in its grandeur and power." — the logic behind French silk self-sufficiency
- **Imagery**: Hyacinthe Rigaud's famous portrait of Louis XIV in silk robes (1701, Louvre). Versailles textile collection.
- **Source**: C10 (Farmer), C2 (Prasad)

## Figure 9: Sogdian Merchants (Collective)

- **Period**: 4th–8th century CE
- **Role**: The crucial intermediaries of Silk Road trade
- **Key Contribution**: Iranian-speaking people based in Samarkand who dominated Silk Road commerce for 400+ years. They operated trading networks from Xi'an to Constantinople, translated between cultures, and physically transported silk across Central Asia.
- **Quote**: "The Sogdians left behind letters, contracts, and account books that reveal the mechanics of Silk Road trade in unprecedented detail." — Étienne de la Vaissière
- **Imagery**: Afrasiab murals (Samarkand, 7th century), Sogdian ossuaries, Chinese tomb figurines of Sogdian merchants
- **Source**: C19 (de la Vaissière), C16 (Whitfield)

## Figure 10: Pliny the Elder

- **Period**: 23–79 CE
- **Role**: Roman naturalist and author
- **Key Contribution**: Provides the Roman perspective on silk in *Natural History*. Romans craved silk but deeply misunderstood it — Pliny thought silk grew on trees ("the Seres are famous for the woollen substance obtained from their forests"). His moral criticism of silk extravagance reveals how the material disrupted Roman gender and class politics.
- **Quote**: "So manifold is the labour employed, and so distant is the region of the globe drawn upon, to enable the Roman matron to flaunt transparent raiment in public." — *Natural History*, XI.76
- **Imagery**: Medieval manuscript portraits, the famous Pliny mosaic, Roman textile fragments.
- **Source**: C22 (Pliny, Perseus Tufts)
