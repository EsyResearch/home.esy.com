## Image Sourcing Priority

1. **Wikimedia Commons** — Primary source for public domain and CC-licensed images
2. **Museum collections** — Met, V&A, British Museum, Suzhou Silk Museum (many offer CC0 or public domain)
3. **Library of Congress / BnF** — Silk Road exhibition materials
4. **UNESCO Silk Roads** — Route photography and heritage site images
5. **Jim Thompson House Museum** — Modern section photographs (check rights)

> ⚠️ This essay requires more photography than a typical visual essay. Budget extra time for G4.5 (Image Sourcing) gate.
