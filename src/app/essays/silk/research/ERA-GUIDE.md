## Era Transition Guidance

| Transition | Visual Technique |
|------------|-----------------|
| Era 1 → Era 2 | Slow expansion — from intimate workshop interior to vast desert landscape |
| Era 2 → Era 3 | Route darkens — from open road to shadowed bazaar and candlelit conspiracy |
| Era 3 → Era 4 | Light shifts — from Byzantine gold to European court chandelier |
| Era 4 → Era 5 | Sudden clarity — from ornate to clean, from dim to bright |
| Era 5 → Revelation | Slow intimacy — return to the single thread, the close-up, the quiet |
