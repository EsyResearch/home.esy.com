## Core Thesis

Silk is not a fabric. It is a 5,000-year case study in how a material object — produced by a caterpillar, guarded as a state secret, smuggled across empires, and woven into the first programmable machines — can reshape civilization itself. The thread connects Neolithic China to the birth of computing, and the road named for it connected every major civilization on Earth.

## Key Findings

### 1. Silk is older than we thought
Recent archaeological evidence (C5) pushes silk use back to ~6500 BCE at the Hemudu site — 3,000 years earlier than the traditional Empress Leizu legend date. This means silk predates writing, bronze, and every other "civilization marker" except agriculture itself.

### 2. The Silk Road was never a single road
Valerie Hansen's revisionist history (C1) demonstrates that "the Silk Road" — a term coined by German geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen in 1877 — was not a continuous trade route but a network of shifting paths, with most trade being local relay rather than end-to-end. The essay should honor this nuance while still using the romantic narrative power of the name.

### 3. The Sogdians are the forgotten protagonists
The Sogdian merchants (C19) — Iranian-speaking traders from Samarkand — were the actual connective tissue of Silk Road trade for 400+ years. They operated from Xi'an to Constantinople, translating languages and cultures. Their near-erasure from popular history is a story in itself.

### 4. The silkworm smuggling story is well-documented but contested
Procopius (C3) is the only contemporary source for the Byzantine silkworm smuggling. While the monks are real and the timeline fits, some scholars question whether the eggs came from China proper or from the Khotan region. The essay should present the Procopius account (the narrative power is immense) while acknowledging the scholarly debate.

### 5. The Jacquard-to-computing connection is direct, not metaphorical
Essinger (C15) documents a direct technical lineage: Jacquard's punch cards → Babbage's Analytical Engine → Hollerith's census machine → IBM → modern computing. Ada Lovelace explicitly made the connection (Q13). Silk literally helped birth the information age.

### 6. Jim Thompson's story is the modern narrative anchor
Thompson (C11) provides everything a Movement IV needs: a vivid character, genuine cultural rescue, international intrigue (OSS/CIA background), and a genuinely unsolved mystery. His disappearance on March 26, 1967 is one of the great 20th-century enigmas.

### 7. China still dominates — 80% of global production
The FAO data (C18) shows that after 5,000 years, China still produces ~80% of the world's raw silk. This is one of the longest-running economic dominances in human history and should be the hook for the Revelation.

## Narrative Arc

### The Through-Line
A single silk thread — followed from the mulberry leaf where it begins, across 5,000 years, through the hands of empresses, monks, merchants, weavers, and programmers, to the screen where you're reading this now.

### Movement Mapping

| Movement | Era | Emotional Arc | Key Set Pieces |
|----------|-----|---------------|----------------|
| I. Invocation | Timeless | Wonder, sensory immersion | A thread catches light; a loom's rhythm; cocoon shimmer |
| II. Ancestral | 6500 BCE – 200 CE | Mystery → ambition → reach | Leizu legend, silkworm lifecycle, Zhang Qian's journey, Roman obsession |
| III. Collision | 300 – 1800 CE | Intrigue → power → exploitation | Monks' smuggling, Sogdian networks, European silk wars, Lyon workers' revolt |
| IV. Modern Echo | 1800 – present | Innovation → loss → revival | Jacquard → computing, Jim Thompson's revival and vanishing, modern industry |
| V. Revelation | Timeless | Stillness, connection | One thread, 5,000 years. China still makes 80%. The caterpillar doesn't know. |

## Research Gaps

### G1. Exact monk identities
No primary source names the two Nestorian monks who smuggled silkworm eggs. Procopius identifies them only as monks "from India" (likely meaning Central Asia). We cannot claim names.

### G2. Silkworm egg route
Scholarly debate exists over whether the eggs came from China proper, Khotan, or somewhere in Central Asia. The essay should present Procopius's account as the primary narrative while noting the uncertainty.

### G3. Jim Thompson disappearance theories
Multiple theories exist (tiger attack, Communist abduction, CIA silencing). Warren's biography (C11) is authoritative but acknowledges no definitive answer. Present as an unsolved mystery — do not favor any theory.

### G4. Working conditions in modern silk production
Contemporary silk production involves ethical questions (silkworm killing in conventional sericulture, labor conditions in developing countries). The essay should acknowledge these without becoming a polemic — the Modern Echo can touch this briefly.

## Photography Notes

This essay is specified as **photography-heavy**. The research confirms extensive image availability:
- **Wikimedia Commons**: Strong coverage of Silk Road landscapes, museum textiles, historical portraits
- **Museum collections**: Met, V&A, British Museum all have substantial online silk textile collections with open-access images
- **LOC/BnF**: Silk Road exhibition materials are well-documented
- **Jim Thompson House Museum**: Modern section anchor — publicly accessible photographs

**Estimated image count**: 30–38 photographs across all movements, with the heaviest density in Movements II and III.
