# G4.1 Design Research Reconciliation — Silk

## Audit 1: Thematic Authenticity

**Status**: ✅ PASS

Every design token traces to the physical, cultural, or historical properties of silk:

| Token | Subject Derivation | Authentic? |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| `--silk-gold` (#C9A84C) | Raw Bombyx mori silk filament color | ✅ Direct material property |
| `--silk-ivory` (#F5F0E8) | Undyed silk fabric | ✅ Direct material property |
| `--silk-deep` (#1A1510) | Interior of silkworm cocoon | ✅ Direct material property |
| `--silk-cocoon` (#E8DCC8) | Dried cocoon surface | ✅ Direct material property |
| `--silk-mulberry` (#6B3A5C) | Mulberry fruit — the silkworm's only food | ✅ Subject-derived |
| `--silk-jade` (#4A7C59) | Chinese jade — companion precious material | ✅ Cultural context |
| `--silk-lapis` (#264B8C) | Lapis lazuli traded on the Silk Road | ✅ Historical trade route |
| `--silk-sand` (#D4C5A9) | Taklamakan Desert sand | ✅ Silk Road geography |
| `--silk-byzantine` (#6B2D75) | Tyrian purple — Byzantine imperial silk | ✅ Historical textile tradition |
| `--silk-mosaic` (#C4A235) | San Vitale mosaic gold tesserae | ✅ Historical artifact |
| `--silk-crimson` (#8B1A1A) | Lyon silk industry red | ✅ Historical textile tradition |
| `--silk-lyon` (#D4AF37) | French court gold | ✅ Historical period |

**Typography**: Georgia serif chosen for timeless readability — appropriate for a 5,000-year narrative. Not ornamental, not cold. Decision is defensible.

**Animation philosophy**: "Move Like Silk" — all timing curves derived from silk's physical drape behavior. No bouncing, no snapping. Easing functions model fabric physics. Shimmer keyframe animation directly replicates silk's light-refracting properties.

**No generic tokens detected.** All design decisions trace to subject matter.

## Audit 2: Cross-Essay Novelty

**Status**: ✅ PASS

Checked against published essays and specs in `orchestration/skills/visual-essay-invocation/specs/`:

| Dimension | Silk | Nearest Neighbor | Collision? |
|-----------|------|-----------------|------------|
| Primary gold (#C9A84C) | Raw silk gold | The Fork uses silver/steel palette | ✅ No collision |
| Background (#F5F0E8) | Warm ivory | Several essays use light backgrounds, but silk's warm undertone is distinct | ✅ No collision |
| Byzantine purple (#6B2D75) | Era-specific accent | No other essay uses this purple | ✅ No collision |
| Serif typography | Georgia | The Fork uses Georgia; but era treatments are completely different | ⚠️ Shared typeface, distinct application |
| Shimmer animation | Silk light refraction | No other essay has this signature animation | ✅ Unique |
| Progress indicator | Thread metaphor | The Fork uses "Tine Counter" — completely different | ✅ No collision |
| MigrationTrail | Silk Road route | No other essay uses this specific route | ✅ Unique |

**Note on Georgia**: Shared with The Fork, but the era color treatments, animation philosophy, and overall aesthetic are entirely distinct. Georgia is a utility choice, not an identity choice. No change needed.

**No collisions detected.**

## Audit 3: Document Completeness

**Status**: ✅ PASS

| Component from Spec | Design Token/Spec Exists? | Implementation-Ready? |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Color palette (10+ tokens) | ✅ 12 era tokens + 4 primary + 4 functional | ✅ Hex, RGB, usage |
| Typography scale | ✅ 8 levels specified | ✅ Family, size, weight, line-height, tracking |
| Animation durations | ✅ 10+ specified | ✅ Duration, easing, usage |
| Shimmer signature animation | ✅ CSS keyframe provided | ✅ Implementation-ready |
| Reduced motion | ✅ Full specification | ✅ All overrides documented |
| Photography processing | ✅ 5 era treatments | ✅ Color temp, saturation, grain, special |
| Layout grid | ✅ Desktop + mobile | ✅ Content width, padding, breakpoints |
| Spacing scale | ✅ 6 tokens | ✅ Values and usage |
| Progress indicator | ✅ Thread metaphor specified | ✅ Position, visual, data structure |
| MigrationTrail design | ✅ Map style, colors, interactions | ✅ |
| IngredientOracle design | ✅ Layout, colors, interactions | ✅ |
| TimefoldSlider design | ✅ Layout, colors, interactions | ✅ |
| Scroll-lock sequences (6) | ✅ All specified in spec | ✅ Choreography in spec Layer 2-4 |
| Era transitions | ✅ Color transition rules | ✅ Which tokens shift when |

**All invocation spec components have corresponding design specifications.**

## Slop Prevention Check

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Any "inspired by Material Design" language? | ✅ No |
| Any generic tech palette (blue/gray)? | ✅ No |
| Any borrowed-from-template animations? | ✅ No — custom shimmer keyframe |
| Would a reader recognize this as a silk essay from the palette alone? | ✅ Yes — gold/ivory/purple is distinctly silk |
| Does the design research reference any other essay? | ✅ No cross-references |
