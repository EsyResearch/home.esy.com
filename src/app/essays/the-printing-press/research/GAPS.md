# Research Gaps: The Printing Press — A Global History

> Research compiled: December 18, 2025

## Overview

This document identifies claims, details, or areas where research could not be fully verified, remains uncertain, or requires additional investigation. **Do not make claims in the spec or essay that rely on unverified information listed here.**

---

## Category 1: Unverifiable Quotes

### Gap 1.1: Gutenberg Quote Attribution
**Claimed Quote**:
> "Religious truth is imprisoned in a small number of little manuscripts which guard the common treasures instead of expanding them. Let us break the seal which binds these holy things; let us give wings to truth..."

**Status**: UNVERIFIED
**Issue**: This quote is widely attributed to Gutenberg on the internet, but no primary source has been identified. Gutenberg left very few personal writings.
**Recommendation**: Do not use this quote, or use with explicit caveat ("attributed to Gutenberg, though the source is uncertain").

---

## Category 2: Uncertain Dates

### Gap 2.1: Gutenberg's Birth Year
**Range**: c. 1394–1406 (most commonly cited: c. 1400)
**Issue**: No birth record survives. Estimates vary by over a decade.
**Recommendation**: Use "c. 1400" with acknowledgment of uncertainty.

### Gap 2.2: Exact Date of Press Invention
**Range**: "around 1440" or "between 1440 and 1450"
**Issue**: No dated document marks the moment of invention.
**Recommendation**: Use "around 1440" or "by the 1440s."

### Gap 2.3: Bi Sheng's Exact Dates
**Range**: c. 972–1051; invention between 1039–1048
**Issue**: Shen Kuo's account doesn't give precise years.
**Recommendation**: Use "around 1040" for the invention.

## Category 3: Missing Imagery

### Gap 3.1: No Contemporary Portraits
**Affected Figures**:
- Bi Sheng (no portraits exist)
- Johannes Gutenberg (earliest portrait is 1584 engraving, over 100 years after death)
- Wang Zhen (no portraits exist)
- Jikji printers Seoksan and Daldam (no portraits exist)
- Johann Fust (no confirmed portraits)
- William Caxton (no contemporary portraits)

**Recommendation**: Use artifact imagery, reconstructions, and later engravings with appropriate context. Do not present post-hoc portraits as contemporary.

### Gap 3.2: Heungdeok Temple (Jikji Printing Site)
**Issue**: The original temple where Jikji was printed no longer exists.
**Recommendation**: Use reconstructions or Cheongju Early Printing Museum imagery.

---

## Category 4: Contested Historical Claims

### Gap 4.1: Number of Gutenberg Bibles Printed
**Range**: 158–185 copies
**Issue**: Contemporary sources cite different numbers; scholars estimate based on surviving copies.
**Recommendation**: Use "approximately 180 copies" or "between 160 and 185 copies."

### Gap 4.2: Fust as "Villain"
**Contested Claim**: "Fust ruined Gutenberg financially"
**Modern Scholarship**: Recent research suggests Gutenberg was not ruined; he maintained property, repaid other loans, and continued printing.
**Recommendation**: Present the lawsuit factually without characterizing Fust as villain. Note that modern scholarship has revised the "greedy financier" narrative.

### Gap 4.3: Direct Asian-to-European Transmission
**Question**: Did knowledge of Asian printing techniques reach Gutenberg?
**Status**: No direct evidence of transmission. Most scholars believe Gutenberg developed his system independently.
**Recommendation**: Do not claim direct transmission. Present Asian and European developments as parallel tracks, with Gutenberg's system as an independent synthesis.

## Category 5: Statistical Uncertainties

### Gap 5.1: Exact Literacy Rates (Pre-1600)
**Issue**: Historical literacy data before the 17th century is fragmentary and based on indirect measures (signature rates, etc.).
**Recommendation**: Use ranges and note methodology limitations. Example: "approximately 30% of European adults" rather than precise figures.

### Gap 5.2: Exact Book Counts
**Claims**:
- "30,000 manuscripts in Europe before printing"
- "9–20 million books by 1500"

**Issue**: These are scholarly estimates with significant variation.
**Recommendation**: Use the range ("9 to 20 million") or note it's an estimate.

### Gap 5.3: Luther Pamphlet Statistics
**Claims**:
- "400,000 copies" (1517–1520)
- "2 million copies" (by 1525)

**Status**: These come from scholarly sources but are estimates based on edition sizes.
**Recommendation**: Present as estimates: "an estimated 400,000 copies."

## Category 6: Areas Requiring Additional Research

### Gap 6.1: Japanese Printing Depth
**Current Coverage**: Brief mention of Hyakumantō Darani (770)
**Missing**: Deeper context on Japanese woodblock tradition, ukiyo-e development
**Recommendation**: If deeper Japanese coverage is needed, conduct additional research. Current mention is factually accurate but thin.

### Gap 6.2: Islamic World Printing History
**Current Coverage**: Brief contextual mention
**Missing**:
- Detailed reasons for late adoption
- Specific dates and figures for Ottoman printing
- Nuanced discussion of religious/cultural factors

**Recommendation**: Current framing (late adoption, 1720s for Arabic script) is accurate. Deeper coverage would require specialized research.

### Gap 6.3: Indian Subcontinent
**Current Coverage**: Single line mention (textile block printing, European missionary presses)
**Missing**: Detailed history of Indian printing traditions
**Recommendation**: Keep coverage minimal unless scope expands.

### Gap 6.4: Economic Analysis Depth
**Current Coverage**: Basic cost comparisons and economic factors
**Missing**:
- Detailed guild system analysis
- Paper cost analysis
- Specific price data by region/decade

**Recommendation**: Current economic framing is accurate for general audience. Academic-level economic history would require specialized research.

## Category 7: Potential Anachronisms to Avoid

### Gap 7.1: "Information Revolution" Language
**Risk**: Applying modern tech-industry framing to 15th-century events
**Recommendation**: Use period-appropriate language where possible; if using "revolution," do so sparingly and with awareness.

### Gap 7.2: "Going Viral" for Luther
**Risk**: Anachronistic internet-age metaphor
**Status**: Some academic sources use this framing (Duke University, Wisconsin)
**Recommendation**: Acceptable if used knowingly; consider "spread rapidly" as alternative.

## Do Not Claim Without Further Research

1. ❌ Gutenberg personally said [unverified quote]
2. ❌ Exact number of Gutenberg Bibles printed (use "approximately")
3. ❌ Direct transmission of printing knowledge from Asia to Europe
4. ❌ Fust "ruined" Gutenberg (use neutral "won the lawsuit")
5. ❌ Precise literacy percentages before 1600 (use estimates)
6. ❌ Contemporary portraits of Gutenberg, Bi Sheng, or Caxton exist
