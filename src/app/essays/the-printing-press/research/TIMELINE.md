## Timeline Visualization Notes

### Scroll-Lock Moment Candidates
1. **Diamond Sutra emergence** (868) — oldest printed book revealed
2. **Bi Sheng's clay type process** — step-by-step typesetting demonstration
3. **Gutenberg Bible page emerging** — the pressing mechanism in action
4. **Map animation** — printing spreading across Europe (1455–1500)
5. **Luther's viral moment** — 95 Theses spreading in real-time
6. **Books counter** — 30,000 → 20,000,000 in 50 years

### Parallel Timeline Concept
- **Left track**: Asian innovations (China → Korea → Japan)
- **Right track**: European development (Gutenberg → Continental spread)
- **Convergence point**: Show that Europe's success built on Asian foundations
