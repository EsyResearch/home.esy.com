## Primary Source Quotes

### 1. Shen Kuo on Bi Sheng's Movable Type (c. 1088)
**Source**: *Dream Pool Essays* (*Mengxi Bitan*), translated in Thomas Carter's *The Invention of Printing in China* (1955)

> "He took sticky clay and cut in it characters as thin as the edge of a copper coin. Each character formed, as it were, a single type. He baked them in the fire to make them hard."

> "He had previously prepared an iron plate and he had covered his plate with a mixture of pine resin, wax, and paper ashes. When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type."

> "He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone."

> "For each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page."

**Context**: Only surviving contemporary account of Bi Sheng's invention. Shen Kuo was an eminent Song dynasty scholar and scientist who documented Bi Sheng's method after retiring (c. 1088).
