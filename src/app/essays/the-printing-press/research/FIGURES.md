## Priority 1: Core Figures (Must Include)

### Bi Sheng (毕昇) — c. 972–1051
**Role**: Inventor of movable type
**Location**: Song Dynasty, China
**Key Contribution**: Created the world's first movable type system using fired clay/ceramic tiles (1039–1048)

**Biography**:
- Commoner artisan during the Song Dynasty (960–1279)
- Little is known about his life due to his non-elite status
- Invention documented by scholar Shen Kuo in *Dream Pool Essays* (c. 1088)

**The Innovation**:
- Cut characters into sticky clay "as thin as the edge of a copper coin"
- Baked clay pieces to harden them
- Used iron plate covered with pine resin, wax, and paper ashes
- Created multiple copies of common characters (20+ for frequently used ones)
- Organized type by rhyme-group in wooden cases

**Verified Quote** (via Shen Kuo's account):
> "If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick."
— Shen Kuo describing Bi Sheng's method, *Dream Pool Essays* (c. 1088)

- Ceramic movable type replicas

### Johannes Gutenberg — c. 1400–1468
**Role**: Inventor of the European printing press system
**Location**: Mainz, Germany
**Key Contribution**: Synthesized movable metal type, oil-based ink, and wooden screw press into a viable mass-production system (~1440)

**Biography**:
- Born to wealthy family in Mainz; father in cloth trade
- Trained as goldsmith, gem cutter, and metallurgist
- Family exiled to Strasbourg in 1428 during craftsman revolt
- Returned to Mainz in 1448; established print shop by 1450
- Lost press to financier Johann Fust in 1455 lawsuit
- Granted title "Hofmann" (gentleman of the court) by Archbishop in 1465
- Died 1468; buried in Franciscan church (grave now lost)

**The Innovation**:
- Movable metal type cast from lead-tin-antimony alloy (low melting point, precise)
- Oil-based ink that adhered to metal type
- Hand mold for rapid type casting
- Wooden screw press adapted from wine/olive presses
- System allowed mass production of identical copies

**Verified Quote**:
> "Religious truth is imprisoned in a small number of little manuscripts which guard the common treasures instead of expanding them. Let us break the seal which binds these holy things; let us give wings to truth that it may fly with the Word, no longer prepared at vast expense, but multitudes evermore arising in inexhaustible profusion."
— Attributed to Gutenberg (though attribution debated)

### Johann Fust — c. 1400–1466
**Role**: Financier and later printer
**Location**: Mainz, Germany
**Key Contribution**: Financed Gutenberg's press; acquired it through lawsuit; continued printing with Schöffer

**Biography**:
- Initially a goldsmith, later moneylender

- Partnered with Peter Schöffer; printed Psalter (1457)

**Modern Perspective**:
Recent scholarship suggests Fust did not "ruin" Gutenberg — Gutenberg maintained property, repaid other loans, and continued printing into the 1460s.
