His brother Josef actually suggested the word, derived from the Czech 'robota' meaning 'forced labor' or 'servitude'—fitting for artificial workers created to serve humanity."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "'Robota' is a Czech word meaning 'forced labor,' 'drudgery,' or 'servitude.' It comes from the Old Church Slavonic 'rabota' (servitude) and is related to 'rab' (slave). The word carried connotations of serfdom—the unpaid labor serfs owed to their lords—making it perfect for artificial workers."

These laws shaped decades of robot ethics in fiction."

As robots become more humanlike, our affinity increases until they reach this valley of discomfort, only recovering when they become indistinguishable from humans."
