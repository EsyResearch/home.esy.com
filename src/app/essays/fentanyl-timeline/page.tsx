            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Illicit fentanyl is dangerous because it's extremely potent—a dose as small as 2 milligrams (about the size of a few grains of salt) can be lethal. Street drugs are often laced with fentanyl without users' knowledge, and dosing is unpredictable in illegal manufacturing."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Illicit fentanyl began appearing in the US drug supply around 2013, primarily manufactured in clandestine labs in China and later Mexico. It's cheap to produce and highly potent, making it profitable to mix with heroin, cocaine, and counterfeit pills. The opioid epidemic created demand."
