# SYNTHESIS.md — The Word "Slang"

## Core Narrative

The word **slang** emerged from London's criminal underworld in the mid-18th century, first attested in 1756. It began as an insider term—itself a piece of slang—describing the secret vocabulary of thieves, beggars, and itinerants. Over the following century, its meaning broadened from "criminal jargon" (1756) to "professional jargon" (1801) to "informal, vivid language" (1818).

## Etymology Status

**DISPUTED/UNKNOWN.**

Despite 250+ years of scholarly attention:
- Merriam-Webster: "origin unknown"
- OED: "remains uncertain"
- Leading theory (Isaac Taylor, 1860s; Liberman, 2016): Scandinavian origin via dialect word for narrow strips of land
- The word *slang* is itself an example of what it names: vocabulary of uncertain, marginal origin

## Thematic Through-Lines

### 1. Margin vs. Center
Slang always marks the boundary of "proper" speech. The word names the outside, the excluded, the improper—yet that boundary constantly shifts.

### 2. Documentation as Domestication
Each dictionary (Grose 1785, Hotten 1859, Partridge 1937) both preserves and tames slang. By cataloguing it, lexicographers bring marginal language toward the center.

### 3. Class and Power
Who gets to define "proper" language? Victorian gatekeeping (Bradley's "offence against propriety") vs. American democratization (Mencken's "wit and ingenuity").

### 4. Creativity vs. Decay
Is slang corruption or innovation? The answer depends on who's asking and when. The word itself carries this tension.

### 5. The Word as Example
*Slang* is itself slang: marginal origin, uncertain etymology, gradual legitimization. The word performs what it names.

## Visual Essay Argument

The essay argues that to trace *slang* is to trace the contested boundary between "proper" speech and everything that threatens it. The word began as underworld insider vocabulary and gradually migrated toward respectability—but never fully arrived. It remains a word that names transgression, even as dictionaries (including this visual essay) attempt to pin it down.

The design reinforces this argument:
- Era-specific typography embodies changing attitudes
- The "dictionary entry" motif shows documentation as domestication
- The progression from shadowy to bright mirrors legitimization
- The closing image (mouth in motion) emphasizes that language refuses to hold still

## Research Confidence

| Topic | Confidence | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| First attestation (1756) | HIGH | Multiple sources confirm |
| Semantic evolution | HIGH | OED attestations solid |
| Etymology | LOW | Genuinely disputed |
| Scandinavian theory | MEDIUM | Best hypothesis, unproven |
| Figure biographies | HIGH | Standard reference works |
| Dictionary histories | HIGH | Well-documented |

## Implementation Priorities

1. **First attestation sequence** (Plate 3): Central to essay argument
2. **Etymology uncertainty** (Plate 7): Must convey genuine dispute
3. **Era transitions**: Typography shifts carry meaning
4. **Mencken quote** (Plate 8): Pivotal rehabilitation moment
5. **Sources section**: Citation integrity essential
