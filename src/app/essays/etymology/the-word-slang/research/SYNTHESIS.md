## Executive Summary

The word "slang" first appears in English around **1756**, originally referring to the specialized vocabulary of vagabonds and criminals. Its etymology remains genuinely uncertain—a fitting mystery for a word that names the ungovernable edges of language. Over 270 years, "slang" evolved from a pejorative label for "low" speech into a neutral (even celebratory) term for creative informal language.

## Key Findings

### 1. Earliest Attestation

**Date:** 1756  
**Source:** William Toldervy, *The History of Two Orphans*  
**Context:** "Thomas Throw had been upon the town, knew the slang well"

The OED records this as the earliest clear use of "slang" meaning specialized or cant vocabulary. Earlier uses (1740s) appear in contexts suggesting criminal argot.

**Important distinction:**
- Pre-1800: "slang" often meant specifically *criminal* cant
- Post-1800: gradually broadened to informal/colloquial language generally

### 2. Etymology: The Honest Mystery

The origin of "slang" itself is **genuinely uncertain**. Major theories:

| Theory | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Scandinavian origin** — from Norwegian *slengja* ("to sling," as in "sling words") | Phonetic plausibility; similar metaphor in other languages | ⭐⭐⭐ Plausible |
| **Romani origin** — from Romani vocabulary entering English thieves' cant | Some slang terms do come from Romani; but no direct attestation for "slang" itself | ⭐⭐ Speculative |
| **Cant/argot internal coinage** — created within criminal subcultures | Fits the secretive nature of cant; but no documented coinage | ⭐⭐ Speculative |
| **"Sling language" shortening** — from the phrase meaning to throw words carelessly | Metaphorically appealing; some parallel constructions | ⭐⭐⭐ Plausible |

**Key insight:** The uncertainty is itself meaningful. Slang emerges from oral, marginal, undocumented communities—exactly the populations whose linguistic innovations go unrecorded.

### 3. Semantic Evolution

```
1756-1800:  Criminal cant / thieves' language (strongly pejorative)
     ↓
1800-1850:  Expanded to "low" or "vulgar" speech generally
     ↓
1850-1900:  Recognized as a legitimate object of study (Farmer & Henley)
     ↓
1900-1950:  Partridge era—slang as "language at play"
     ↓
1950-2000:  Neutral/descriptive term in linguistics
     ↓
2000-now:   Often celebrated as creativity, identity, cultural capital
```

### 4. Slang vs. Related Terms

| Term | Definition | Key Distinction |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Slang** | Informal vocabulary used for vividness, in-group identity, or freshness | Broad; not tied to specific profession or criminal activity |
| **Cant** | Secret vocabulary of criminals/underworld | Deliberately secretive; historical term |
| **Argot** | French-derived; specialized group vocabulary | Often used for criminal/marginal groups; more formal register than "slang" |
| **Jargon** | Technical vocabulary of a profession | Not informal; purpose is precision, not play |
| **Vernacular** | Native/everyday language of a region | Broader than slang; includes all non-standard forms |
| **Colloquial** | Conversational/informal register | Overlaps with slang but includes non-slang informality |

### 5. Why Slang Exists: Social Functions

Research consistently identifies these drivers:

1. **In-group identity** — "We speak this way; they don't"
2. **Secrecy** — Originally criminal cant; now youth hiding from parents
3. **Freshness/play** — Avoiding worn-out expressions
4. **Economy** — Shorter, punchier expressions
5. **Taboo avoidance** — Euphemism and dysphemism
6. **Rebellion** — Rejecting "proper" language as authority
7. **Creativity** — Language as art form

### 6. The Half-Life Problem

Slang words follow a predictable lifecycle:

```
BIRTH → COOL → MAINSTREAM → CRINGE → FOSSIL
  ↓        ↓         ↓          ↓        ↓
(coined)  (in-group) (adopted)  (dated)  (historical)
          identity   by outsiders        curiosity
```

**Why?** Once slang loses its in-group exclusivity, it loses its social function. Speakers innovate new terms to restore the boundary.

## Gaps & Uncertainties

1. **Pre-1750 oral usage** — "Slang" was almost certainly used before 1756; we lack written records
2. **Exact etymology** — No definitive source; all theories remain hypotheses
3. **Non-English parallels** — More research needed on whether other languages have equivalent meta-terms
4. **Digital slang velocity** — Quantitative data on acceleration of slang cycles online is limited

## Research Confidence Matrix

| Claim | Confidence | Source Depth |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| First attested 1756 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | OED, multiple corroborations |
| Etymology uncertain | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | Scholarly consensus |
| Scandinavian theory most plausible | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium | Phonetic evidence only |
| Semantic broadening 1800s | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | Dictionary evidence |
| Social functions | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | Extensive sociolinguistic research |
| Internet acceleration | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | McCulloch, observable data |

## Implications for Essay

1. **Lead with the mystery** — Etymology uncertainty is narratively compelling
2. **Distinguish word from phenomenon** — "Slang" (term) vs slang (behavior)
3. **Show the shift** — From criminal taint to creative celebration
4. **Use the half-life** — Visual opportunity for lifecycle diagram
5. **Avoid false certainty** — Label theories with confidence levels
