# GAPS.md — The Word "Slang"

## Research Gaps and Uncertainties

### Unverifiable Claims (DO NOT ASSERT AS FACT)

| Claim | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Definitive etymology of "slang" | ❌ UNPROVEN | Multiple theories; none definitively proven |
| Scandinavian origin confirmed | ❌ UNPROVEN | "Prime suspect" per OED, but not confirmed |
| Exact date of first oral usage | ❌ UNKNOWN | Written attestation 1756; oral use earlier but undocumented |
| John Sampson's 1898 article | ⚠️ NOT VERIFIED | Cited by Liberman; original not located |
| Isaac Taylor's original 1860s publication | ⚠️ NOT VERIFIED | Theory referenced; original text not consulted |

### How to Handle in Essay

**Etymology Section**:
- Present as "disputed" or "uncertain"
- Use phrases: "the leading theory proposes...", "scholars have suggested..."
- Quote Merriam-Webster directly: "origin unknown"
- Quote OED: "remains uncertain"
- Never state definitively that slang comes from Scandinavian

**Timeline**:
- Mark 1756 as "first attestation" not "first use"
- Note that oral usage predated written record
- Flag Isaac Taylor's theory as "proposed" not "established"

## Imagery Gaps

| Figure | Portrait Available? | Mitigation |
|--------|---------------------|------------|
| William Toldervy | ❌ Unknown | Use book imagery or period typography |
| B.E. Gentleman | ❌ Anonymous | Title page only |
| Isaac Taylor | ⚠️ Uncertain | May exist; use text instead if needed |
| Connie Eble | ⚠️ Not confirmed | Use campus imagery instead |

## Claims to Present as Uncertain

### MUST qualify with uncertainty:

1. **Etymology**: "Origin unknown" or "disputed etymology"
2. **Scandinavian theory**: "Leading hypothesis" not "established fact"
3. **Taylor's narrow-land theory**: "Proposed in the 1860s" not "proven"
4. **Oral usage before 1756**: "Likely" but "undocumented"
5. **Liberman's "solved" claim**: Note that OED still says "uncertain"

### Language to use:

- "The most attractive unproven theory..."
- "Scholars have proposed..."
- "The OED considers this 'the prime but unproven suspect'..."
- "Despite claims that the origin 'is known'..."
- "Merriam-Webster states simply: 'origin unknown'"

### Language to AVOID:

- "Slang comes from..."
- "The word derives from..."
- "The etymology is..."
- "It is known that..."
- Any definitive statement about origin

## Source Limitations

| Source | Limitation | Impact |
|--------|------------|--------|
| OED "rise and rise" article | 403 for non-subscribers | Cross-verified via other sources |
| Sampson 1898 article | Not located | Cited secondhand via Liberman |
| Original Toldervy novel | Not digitized for images | Use period typography recreation |
| Taylor's original paper | Not consulted directly | Theory cited via OED |

## Future Research Needs

If implementing a follow-up or expansion:

1. **Locate Sampson 1898 article**: *Chester Courant*—verify Liberman's claims
2. **Consult Taylor's original**: Identify exact publication from 1860s
3. **Verify Toldervy passage**: Page number and volume from 1756 original
4. **Academic sociolinguistics**: More recent work post-Eble (1996)
5. **Digital slang scholarship**: Academic work on Urban Dictionary, TikTok

## Quality Control Notes

### Before Publication, Verify:

- [ ] No etymology stated as fact
- [ ] "Origin unknown" appears prominently
- [ ] Scandinavian theory presented as hypothesis
- [ ] Taylor credited but not confirmed
- [ ] 1756 marked as "first attestation" not "origin"
- [ ] Gaps.md items not asserted in narrative
- [ ] All quotes verified against QUOTES.md
- [ ] All figures sourced per FIGURES.md

### Red Flags to Catch in Review:

- Definitive etymology statements
- "Slang derives from..." without qualification
- Missing "uncertain" or "disputed" language
- Treating Liberman's claim as consensus
- Asserting Scandinavian origin as fact
