/* ============================================
   THE WORD "ESSAY" — A HISTORY OF ATTEMPTING TO THINK
   ============================================
   A typography-forward visual essay where the word itself
   is the protagonist. Era-appropriate typefaces tell the
   story of the essay form across 450 years.
   
   Design Philosophy: Typography as hero, not decoration.
   The word "Essay" morphs through Garamond → Caslon → 
   Baskerville → Gill Sans as eras change.

            The word <em>essay</em> contains a philosophy.
          </p>
          <p>
            It comes from the French <em>essayer</em>—to try, to attempt, to test. 
            When Michel de Montaigne titled his 1580 work <em>Essais</em>, he wasn&apos;t 
            being modest. He was being radical.
          </p>
          <p>
            He named his works after the <strong>process</strong> of thinking, 
            not the <strong>product</strong> of thought. This embedded humility 
            into an entire literary form.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the story of that word, that form, that 450-year tradition of attempting.

              Every time you write something exploratory, tentative, or searching, 
              you participate in a 450-year tradition of attempting—and the word 
              for this attempt contains a philosophy: ideas are to be weighed, not declared.
