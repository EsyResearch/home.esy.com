## Scope & Intent

### Core Thesis

The English word *phone* is a 2,500-year compression — from the ancient Greek *phonē* (φωνή), meaning voice, sound, or utterance, through its absorption into scientific Latin compounds (*telephone*, *phonograph*, *microphone*), to its modern truncation into the most ubiquitous noun of the 21st century. The essay traces how a word that once meant the human voice became the name for a device that has fundamentally altered how that voice travels.

### Narrative Arc

1. **Origin** — φωνή (*phonē*) in ancient Greek: voice, sound, utterance. Its use in Homer, Aristotle, and the Greek theatrical tradition. The mouth as the original phone.
2. **The Latin Bridge** — How Greek *phonē* entered scientific and ecclesiastical Latin. The birth of compound-building: *phon-* as a productive root meaning "sound" in European intellectual tradition.
3. **The Compound Explosion** — The 19th century's hunger for Greek roots: *telephone* (far-sound, 1835–1876), *phonograph* (sound-writer, 1877), *microphone* (small-sound, 1827), *gramophone*, *saxophone* (via Adolphe Sax + *phonē*). Each compound tells a story of invention needing a name.
4. **The Bell Moment** — Alexander Graham Bell, Elisha Gray, and the race to patent "the telephone." How a Greek compound became the name of a revolution. The word enters everyday speech.
5. **The Great Truncation** — How *telephone* became *phone*. Clipping as linguistic evolution. When a word becomes so common it sheds its prefix. The 20th century: phone booth, phone book, phone call, phone tag.
6. **The Smartphone Singularity** — *Phone* now names a device that is camera, computer, map, wallet, and library — yet we still call it a *phone*, even though calling is its least-used function. The word has outlived its meaning. What does that tell us about language?

### Target Audience

Language and linguistics enthusiasts. Readers who love word origins, are curious about how language evolves, and appreciate the hidden histories embedded in everyday vocabulary. Educated general audience with an appetite for intellectual wonder.

### Tone & Voice

**Sense of wonder** — The essay should feel like discovering something astonishing hiding in plain sight. Marveling at how a 2,500-year-old Greek word ended up in everyone's pocket. Authoritative but never dry. The reader should finish feeling that the word *phone* will never sound the same again.

### Estimated Read Time

20–25 minutes (deep depth)

### Special Requirements

- **Greek typography**: The essay must render φωνή and other Greek terms beautifully — they are visual content, not footnotes
- **Compound word visualizations**: Show the morphological anatomy of telephone, microphone, phonograph, etc. (tele + phonē, micro + phonē)
- **Linguistic precision**: Etymology claims must be sourced to reputable dictionaries and linguistic scholarship (OED, Liddell-Scott, Beekes)
- **No folk etymology**: Every derivation must be verified. No "telephone means far-voice" without citing the actual Greek components and their attestation
- **The living word**: Emphasize that *phone* is still evolving (smartphone, FaceTime as verb, "phone" as metonym for internet access)

---

## Approved Depth Mode

- [ ] Quick (5–10 sources)
- [ ] Standard (10–15 sources, 5–10 figures, 10+ verified quotes)
- [x] **Deep** (15–25 primary sources, comprehensive linguistic documentation)

**Rationale**: The word *phonē* has a rich 2,500-year paper trail across Greek, Latin, French, and English. Deep depth allows proper documentation of each etymological stage, the 19th-century compound explosion, and the modern semantic drift. Tier 1 sources (OED, Liddell-Scott Greek Lexicon, Beekes' *Etymological Dictionary of Greek*) are abundant and authoritative.

## Key Research Questions

1. What is the Proto-Indo-European root of φωνή, and what is the scholarly consensus on its derivation?
2. How did φωνή function semantically in ancient Greek — was it always "voice" or did it encompass broader "sound"?
3. When and how did Greek *phon-* become a productive combining form in European scientific vocabulary?
4. Who first coined the word *telephone*, and what was the gap between the word and the device?
5. How did the clipping from *telephone* to *phone* happen linguistically — when did dictionaries accept *phone* as standard?
6. What is the current semantic range of *phone* — has it undergone semantic broadening, narrowing, or shift?
7. How do other languages handle the same word? (French *téléphone*, German *Telefon*, Japanese 電話 *denwa* = "electric speech", Mandarin 电话 *diànhuà* = "electric speech")
