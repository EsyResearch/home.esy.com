# Figures — Phonē: From Voice to Device

> Key figures in the life of the word φωνή/phone, with verified biographical data and linguistic contributions.

---

## F1: Homer (fl. ~8th c. BCE)
- **Role**: Earliest literary source for φωνή
- **Key Facts**:
  - The Iliad and Odyssey contain numerous uses of φωνή meaning "voice" and "sound"
  - φωνή in Homer describes both human voice and divine utterance
  - The Homeric poems are the earliest surviving extensive Greek texts, making them the first literary attestation of the word
- **Linguistic Contribution**: Establishes φωνή as part of the Greek literary vocabulary from the earliest surviving texts
- **Sources**: S1 (Beekes), S2 (LSJ)

## F2: Aristotle (384–322 BCE)
- **Role**: First philosopher to systematically analyze φωνή as a linguistic concept
- **Key Facts**:
  - In *De Interpretatione*, defines φωνή as "a sound significant by convention"
  - Distinguishes human φωνή (conventional meaning) from animal sounds (natural signs)
  - Establishes the framework: voice → thought → thing — φωνή as the bridge between mind and world
- **Quotable**: "Spoken words are the symbols of mental experience" (*De Interpretatione*, 16a3, trans. Ackrill)
- **Linguistic Contribution**: Transforms φωνή from a common word into a philosophical concept — the earliest theory of how voice carries meaning
- **Sources**: S7 (De Interpretatione), S2 (LSJ)

## F3: Sir Charles Wheatstone (1802–1875)
- **Role**: Coined *microphone* (1827)
- **Key Facts**:
  - English physicist and inventor, professor at King's College London
  - Published "Experiments on Audition" in *Quarterly Journal of Science* (1827)
  - Created *microphone* (Greek mikros + phonē = "small-sound") for an acoustic device that amplified faint sounds — a metallic binaural stethoscope
  - Also contributed to the development of the telegraph
- **Linguistic Contribution**: First person to create a new -phone compound for a technological device. The modern meaning (electrical transducer) came later (1878), but Wheatstone gave the word to English.
- **Sources**: S3 (OED), S14 (Etymonline)

## F4: Jean-François Sudré (1787–1862)
- **Role**: First user of the word *téléphone* (French, ~1828)
- **Key Facts**:
  - French musician and inventor
  - Devised a system of musical communication ("Solresol") that transmitted words as musical notes
  - Called this system *téléphone* (Greek tele + phonē = "far-sound")
  - The system was impractical and abandoned, but the word survived
- **Linguistic Contribution**: Coined the word *téléphone* for something completely different from what it now means. The word outlived its original referent — a striking example of semantic reassignment.
- **Sources**: S3 (OED), S14 (Etymonline)

## F5: Adolphe Sax (1814–1894)
- **Role**: Namesake of the *saxophone* (1846)
- **Key Facts**:
  - Belgian instrument maker born in Dinant, Belgium
  - Invented the saxophone around 1840, patented June 28, 1846
  - The name *saxophone* = Sax + phonē ("Sax-sound" or "the sound/voice of Sax")
  - Originally intended for military bands as a more sonorous substitute for the clarinet
- **Linguistic Contribution**: Demonstrates the versatility of -phone as a combining form — it can attach to a personal name, not just a Greek prefix. The saxophone is the only major instrument named with the -phone suffix and a person's name.
- **Sources**: S14 (Etymonline), S3 (OED)

## F6: Johann Philipp Reis (1834–1874)
- **Role**: Coined German *Telephon* and built first telephone device (1861)
- **Key Facts**:
  - German self-taught scientist and physics teacher in Friedrichsdorf
  - Demonstrated a sound-transmitting device to the Physical Society of Frankfurt, October 26, 1861
  - His device transmitted musical tones with "astonishing correctness" but struggled with articulate speech
  - Used both German *Telephon* and English *telephone* in his descriptions
  - Died of tuberculosis at 40, a decade before Bell's patent
- **Quotable**: Called his device *das Telephon* — "the far-sounder"
- **Linguistic Contribution**: First person to use *telephone/Telephon* for an electrical sound-transmitting device (15 years before Bell). Established the word-device link that Bell would cement.
- **Sources**: S9 (Reis), S11 (Casson)

## F7: Alexander Graham Bell (1847–1922)
- **Role**: Patented the telephone (1876); made *telephone* a global word
- **Key Facts**:
  - Scottish-born American inventor, professor of vocal physiology at Boston University
  - Filed US Patent 174,465 on February 14, 1876 — same day as Elisha Gray's caveat
  - Patent titled "Improvement in Telegraphy" — used the word *telephone* for his voice-transmission apparatus
  - His father and grandfather were both elocution experts; Bell's lifework was the human voice
  - Married Mabel Hubbard, who was deaf — the telephone was born from a life devoted to the mechanics of voice
- **Quotable**: "Mr. Watson — come here — I want to see you." (First intelligible words transmitted by telephone, March 10, 1876)
- **Linguistic Contribution**: Did not coin *telephone*, but made it the most recognized compound word on Earth. Bell's patent is the moment a Greek word enters every household.
- **Sources**: S8 (Bell Patent), S15 (Everson), S11 (Casson)

## F8: Elisha Gray (1835–1901)
- **Role**: Filed telephone caveat the same day as Bell (Feb 14, 1876)
- **Key Facts**:
  - American electrical engineer, co-founder of Western Electric
  - Developed a liquid transmitter telephone independently of Bell
  - His caveat (preliminary patent filing) arrived at the Patent Office the same day as Bell's full application
  - Lost the patent race by hours; spent years in legal dispute
- **Linguistic Contribution**: The Bell-Gray dispute established that the *word* telephone, once attached to a patent, became legally and commercially powerful — naming as ownership.
- **Sources**: S15 (Everson), S8 (Bell Patent)

## F9: Thomas Edison (1847–1931)
- **Role**: Coined *phonograph* (1877)
- **Key Facts**:
  - American inventor; coined *phonograph* (Greek phonē + graphē = "sound-writer") for his sound-recording device
  - Also popularized *megaphone* (Greek megas + phonē = "great-sound")
  - The phonograph/telephone distinction (recording vs. transmitting) crystallized the -graph/-phone split in English
- **Quotable**: "Mary had a little lamb" — the first words recorded on the phonograph (1877)
- **Linguistic Contribution**: Created the -phone vs. -graph semantic distinction: -phone = sound transmission, -graph = sound recording. This distinction persists.
- **Sources**: S3 (OED), S14 (Etymonline)
