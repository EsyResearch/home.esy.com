## Era I: The Greek Word (8th c. BCE – 1st c. CE)

| Date | Event | Linguistic Significance | Source |
|------|-------|------------------------|--------|
| ~8th c. BCE | φωνή (phonē) appears in Homeric Greek (Iliad, Odyssey) | Earliest literary attestation; means "voice," "sound," "utterance" | S1 (Beekes), S2 (LSJ) |
| 5th c. BCE | φωνή used extensively in Attic tragedy (Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides) | Semantic range expands: voice, cry, language, dialect, tone of voice | S2 (LSJ) |
| 4th c. BCE | Aristotle uses φωνή systematically in *De Interpretatione* | Defines φωνή as "sound significant by convention" — voice as meaning-bearer | S7 (Aristotle) |
| 4th c. BCE | Plato uses φωνή in *Cratylus* and *Theaetetus* | φωνή in philosophical discussion of language and naming | S2 (LSJ) |
| 2nd c. BCE–2nd c. CE | Greek grammarians (Dionysius Thrax, Apollonius Dyscolus) formalize φωνή | φωνή becomes a technical grammatical term: "articulate sound," "letter" | S2 (LSJ), S12 (Horrocks) |

### Linguistic Note: In ancient Greek, φωνή already had dual character — both the physical phenomenon of sound and the linguistic phenomenon of meaningful speech. This duality persists in all its descendants.

## Era II: The Latin Bridge (1st – 17th c. CE)

| Date | Event | Linguistic Significance | Source |
|------|-------|------------------------|--------|
| 1st c. BCE – 5th c. CE | Latin grammarians borrow Greek phonē-compounds | *symphōnia* → Latin *symphonia*; Greek phonological terms enter Latin scholarship | S12 (Horrocks) |
| Medieval period | Greek *phonē* preserved in ecclesiastical and scholarly Latin | Compound-building potential dormant but preserved in monastic learning | S12 (Horrocks) |
| 1590s | *symphony* enters English from Latin/French (< Greek symphōnia) | "together-sound" — first major phonē-descendant in English | S3 (OED), S14 |
| 1623 | *euphony* enters English (< Greek euphōnia) | "good-sound" — aesthetic quality of pleasant speech sounds | S3 (OED), S14 |
| 1656 | *cacophony* enters English (< Greek kakophōnia) | "bad-sound" — the negative counterpart; confirms -phony as productive | S3 (OED), S14 |

### Turning Point: For over 2,000 years, phonē lives quietly in compounds about sound quality. The 19th century will change everything.

## Era III: The Compound Explosion (1827 – 1900)

| Date | Event | Linguistic Significance | Source |
|------|-------|------------------------|--------|
| 1827 | Sir Charles Wheatstone coins *microphone* | "small-sound" — for an acoustic amplification instrument (not electrical) | S3 (OED), S14 |
| 1828 | Jean-François Sudré coins *téléphone* (French) | "far-sound" — for a musical signaling system using notes; the word predates the device | S3 (OED), S17 (Bourseul) |
| 1835 | *telephone* first attested in English | Still refers to Sudré's musical system, not electrical voice transmission | S3 (OED), S14 |
| 1843 | *homophone* enters English | "same-sound" — linguistic terminology for words that sound alike | S3 (OED) |
| 1846 | Adolphe Sax patents the saxophone | *saxophone* = Sax + phonē ("Sax-sound"); patented June 28, 1846 | S14 (Etymonline) |
| 1851 | *saxophone* first attested in English | The word enters English from French | S14 (Etymonline) |
| 1854 | Bourseul publishes electrical voice transmission concept | Describes what we now mean by *telephone* — but the word already exists | S17 (Bourseul) |
| 1861 | Philipp Reis demonstrates *Telephon* in Frankfurt | Reis coins German *Telephon* and uses English *telephone* for his sound-transmitting device | S9 (Reis) |
| 1866 | *xylophone* enters English | "wood-sound" — Greek xylo- + phonē for the percussion instrument | S3 (OED), S14 |
| **1876** | **Bell patents the telephone (Feb 14)** | **The word *telephone* becomes globally famous overnight — attached to the defining invention of the age** | S8 (Bell Patent) |
| 1876 | Gray files telephone caveat same day | The Bell-Gray controversy; the word's legal ownership is contested | S15 (Everson) |
| 1877 | Edison coins *phonograph* | "sound-writer" — for his sound-recording device; -graph vs. -phone distinction crystallizes | S3 (OED), S14 |
| **1878** | ***phone* first attested as standalone word** | **Des Moines Register, May 16, 1878 — "colloquial shortening of telephone"** | S3 (OED), S14 |
| 1878 | *microphone* shifts meaning | Now refers to Hughes's electrical sound transducer (the modern meaning) | S3 (OED), S14 |
| 1884 | *to phone* first attested as verb | "To call on the telephone" — the word becomes a verb within 6 years of its clipping | S3 (OED), S14 |
| 1887 | Berliner coins *gramophone* | "writing-sound" (inverted compound: grapho + phonē) — for his disc player | S3 (OED) |
| 1895 | Century Dictionary defines *phone* | "Colloquial shortening of telephone; generally applied to the receiver, but sometimes to the whole apparatus" | S18 (Century Dict.) |

### Turning Point: In 70 years (1827–1895), Greek phonē spawns more new English words than it had in the previous 2,500 years combined. The 19th century's appetite for Greek roots is insatiable.

## Era IV: The Great Truncation (1900 – 1995)

| Date | Event | Linguistic Significance | Source |
|------|-------|------------------------|--------|
| 1901 | *phone bill* attested | Compound-building begins from the clipped form, not the full *telephone* | S14 (Etymonline) |
| 1906 | *phone booth* attested | The clipped *phone* now generates its own compounds | S14 (Etymonline) |
| ~1920s | *'phone* (with apostrophe) giving way to *phone* | The apostrophe marking omission is dropped; *phone* becomes its own word | S3 (OED), S10 (Crystal) |
| 1920 | *phone book* attested | Not *telephone book* — the clipped form wins in compound-building | S14 (Etymonline) |
| 1920s–1930s | *phone* becomes standard in informal speech | No longer marked as slang; accepted in journalism and everyday usage | S13 (Algeo), S10 (Crystal) |
| 1950s–1970s | *phone* displaces *telephone* in most contexts | *telephone* becomes formal/technical; *phone* is default | S6 (Marchand), S10 (Crystal) |
| 1984 | *car phone* enters common usage | *phone* now modifiable — from object-in-a-place to portable object | S13 (Algeo) |
| 1990 | "SmartPhone" appears in Popular Science (AT&T) | Earliest known use of "smart phone" as compound — still two words | S13 (Algeo) |

### Turning Point: By mid-20th century, *telephone* → *phone* is complete. The clipping is so successful that *phone* generates its own family of compounds, independent of its parent word.

## Era V: The Smartphone Singularity (1995 – Present)

| Date | Event | Linguistic Significance | Source |
|------|-------|------------------------|--------|
| 1994 | IBM Simon released | First device later called a "smartphone" — though the word isn't yet established | S13 |
| 1995 | "smart phone" in print (AT&T PhoneWriter) | Two-word compound; *phone* is now the base for new technology naming | S13 |
| 1997 | Ericsson coins *smartphone* (one word, GS88) | First major brand to use *smartphone* as a single compound | S13 |
| 2007 | iPhone launched | *Phone* is now the name for a pocket computer; voice calling is one of many functions | General knowledge |
| 2010s | *FaceTime* becomes a verb; *phone* = internet access | *Phone* undergoes semantic broadening — it now means "personal computing device" | S10 (Crystal) |
| 2020s | Voice calls are <15% of phone usage | The word *phone* (from φωνή, "voice") now names a device rarely used for voice | General knowledge |

### Linguistic Note: The word has outlived its etymology. φωνή meant "voice." A smartphone's most-used functions are visual: camera, messaging, browsing. Yet we still call it a *phone*. This semantic fossillization — where a word's meaning drifts far from its origin — is one of the most dramatic in English.
