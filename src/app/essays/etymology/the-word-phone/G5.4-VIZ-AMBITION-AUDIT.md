# G5.4 Visualization Ambition Audit

## Per-Visualization Assessment

### 1. Semantic Constellation

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Technology Tier** | Tier 1 (SVG) |
| **Implementation** | Inline SVG with computed radial positions using trigonometry (cos/sin). 7 labeled nodes at equal angular intervals. Dashed connecting lines. Progressive reveal animation with staggered delays. |
| **Data Encoding** | Angular position encodes sense category. All 7 senses at equal visual weight (correct — no hierarchy). |
| **Interactivity** | Scroll-triggered reveal with staggered appearance |
| **Score** | **3.5/5** — Clean SVG radial layout with proper mathematical positioning. Could be enhanced with hover interactions showing definitions or usage examples. |

### 2. Compound Anatomy Diagrams

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Technology Tier** | Tier 0+ (CSS structured markup) |
| **Implementation** | Color-coded morphological breakdowns: prefix (blue), root (gold), name (copper). 7 compound words with meaning and date. Staggered reveal animation. |
| **Data Encoding** | Color encodes morphological role (prefix vs. root vs. name). Position encodes structure (left-to-right reading order). |
| **Interactivity** | Scroll-triggered reveal |
| **Score** | **3.0/5** — Effective structural representation. Typography-based by design intent (this is an etymology essay where text IS the visualization). Appropriate tier for morphological analysis where the visual IS the word. |

### 3. Word Family Tree

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Technology Tier** | Tier 1 (SVG) |
| **Implementation** | Branching tree SVG with 21 positioned nodes. Parent-child lines with computed geometry. Progressive reveal with staggered fade-in delays. Distinct visual treatment for root node vs. descendant nodes. Scrollable container for mobile. |
| **Data Encoding** | Y-position encodes temporal depth (PIE → modern). X-position groups related branches. Node size distinguishes root from descendants. |
| **Interactivity** | Scroll-triggered progressive reveal simulating tree growth |
| **Score** | **4.0/5** — Genuine data visualization with 21 nodes, computed layout, branching structure, and temporal ordering. Could be enhanced with D3 force-directed layout or interactive zoom. |

### 4. Linguistic Starburst

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Technology Tier** | Tier 1 (SVG) |
| **Implementation** | Radial SVG with 10 translations at computed angular positions. Connecting rays from center. Multi-script text (Latin, CJK, Arabic, Cyrillic, Korean). Progressive reveal with staggered animation. |
| **Data Encoding** | Angular position distributes languages evenly. All at equal radius (no hierarchy — correct, as all are translations of the same word). |
| **Interactivity** | Scroll-triggered reveal |
| **Score** | **3.5/5** — Clean radial visualization with cross-script rendering challenge handled well. Multi-script rendering (10 different writing systems) adds genuine implementation complexity. |

### 5. Compound Cascade

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Technology Tier** | Tier 0+ (CSS animation) |
| **Implementation** | Sequential cascade of 7 compound words, each with highlighted base form (gold) and extension (muted). Chronological order enforced. Staggered slide-in animation. |
| **Data Encoding** | Vertical position encodes chronological order. Color distinguishes base word from compound extension. Date labels provide temporal context. |
| **Interactivity** | Scroll-triggered cascade with staggered delays |
| **Score** | **3.0/5** — Effective sequential reveal. Appropriate for showing compound generation over time. The cascade metaphor matches the linguistic concept of productive word-building. |

### 6. Fossil Comparison

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Technology Tier** | Tier 0 (CSS Grid) |
| **Implementation** | Three-column grid with parallel etymology cards. Each card shows modern word, ancient origin, semantic drift arrow, and reflective caption. |
| **Data Encoding** | Parallel structure encodes comparison. Visual weight (font size) distinguishes modern form from ancient origin. |
| **Interactivity** | Static (within revealed section) |
| **Score** | **3.0/5** — Typographic comparison appropriate for the content. The visual IS the comparison — three words, three fossils, three parallel histories. Would benefit from animated ghost-text layering. |

### 7. Derivation Chain Progress Bar

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Technology Tier** | Tier 0+ (CSS + computed state) |
| **Implementation** | Fixed progress bar that transforms its content (the displayed word) based on scroll position. 6-stage word transformation: φωνή → phonē → -phone → telephone → phone → phone. Stage-specific colors derived from era palette. |
| **Data Encoding** | Position (width) encodes reading progress. Content (the word) encodes the essay's narrative position. Color encodes the current era. |
| **Interactivity** | Continuous scroll-driven transformation |
| **Score** | **4.0/5** — Genuinely novel progress indicator. The content of the progress bar changes as you scroll — the word literally transforms. This is conceptually inventive and technically well-executed. |

### 8. Truncation Animation

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Technology Tier** | Tier 0+ (CSS + state machine) |
| **Implementation** | Multi-stage animation: TELEPHONE letters T-E-L-E transition through three states (remaining → fading → faded). Apostrophe appears briefly, then the counter reveals the linguistic fact. IntersectionObserver-triggered state machine with timed transitions. |
| **Data Encoding** | Letter opacity encodes the clipping process. State progression encodes the temporal sequence of the linguistic change. |
| **Interactivity** | Scroll-triggered three-stage state machine |
| **Score** | **4.5/5** — Excellent animation concept. The visual directly embodies the linguistic process (clipping). The three-stage progression (visible → fading → gone) with the brief apostrophe is a clever touch that mirrors the historical record. |

| Visualization | Technology Tier | Score |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Semantic Constellation | SVG (Tier 1) | 3.5 |
| Compound Anatomy | CSS+ (Tier 0+) | 3.0 |
| Word Family Tree | SVG (Tier 1) | 4.0 |

**Average Score: 3.56** (threshold: 3.5) ✅

## Notes

This is an **etymology essay** where typography IS the primary visualization medium. The word itself is the data. Unlike a data journalism essay where div-width bars would be unacceptable, the Tier 0/0+ visualizations here are design-intentional:

- **Compound Anatomy**: The colored morphological breakdown IS the visualization — you cannot make `tele|phone` more visually ambitious without losing the linguistic precision that is the point.
- **Fossil Comparison**: Parallel typographic comparison IS the format — the reader compares three word histories by reading them side-by-side.
- **Truncation Animation**: A multi-stage typographic state machine that embodies the linguistic process. This is genuinely creative — the animation IS the content.

The 3 SVG visualizations (Constellation, Family Tree, Starburst) use proper computed layouts with mathematical positioning — not div-width hacks.

**G5.4 Status**: ✅ **PASS** — Average Score 3.56 (≥ 3.5 threshold). 3 SVG Tier 1 visualizations. No div-width-percentage bar charts. Visualization ambition appropriate for etymology essay format.
