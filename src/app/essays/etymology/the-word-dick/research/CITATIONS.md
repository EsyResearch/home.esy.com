### Issues Identified

#### ✅ Steven Pinker Quote (Essay line 869-874) — RESOLVED
**Original Quote**: "Words are not just labels for concepts; they are tiny vehicles of meaning that carry cultural freight from one mind to another."
**Status**: ❌ **FABRICATED** — No trace found online; phrases "tiny vehicles of meaning" and "cultural freight" return zero results.

**Resolution**: Replaced with verified quote from *The Stuff of Thought* (2007):
> "When a language isn't up to the conceptual demands of its speakers, they don't scratch their heads dumbfounded; they simply change the language. They stretch it with metaphors and metonyms, borrow words and phrases from other languages, or coin new slang and jargon."

**Verification**: Quote confirmed via [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2839893), [ResearchGate review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269836617), and multiple academic sources.

#### SSA Data Verification
SSA website returned 403 (access blocked). The claims:
- "Fell out of top 1000 names by 1969"
- "Fewer than 5 babies named Dick in 2014"

Are widely cited via Wikipedia but not directly verified against SSA database.
**Recommendation**: Note as "per SSA data via secondary sources" in essay.
