It was the name of ancient Korean confederacies (Samhan) and now appears in Hanguk (韓國, Korea), Hangul (the Korean alphabet), and Hanja (Chinese characters used in Korean).

            "text": "Hangul combines Han (韓, 'great/Korean') with gul (글, 'script'). King Sejong created this alphabet in 1443 to give common Koreans a writing system independent of Chinese characters. The name emphasizes it as the 'great script' or 'Korean script'—a nationalist assertion of cultural identity."

Both derive from 'Han' meaning Chinese/Han Dynasty. The characters are largely the same but with different local pronunciations and some variant forms."

The 400-year Han Dynasty was so influential that Chinese people call themselves 'Han people,' Chinese characters are 'Han characters,' and Chinese language is 'Hanyu.'"
