            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Romance languages abandoned the Latin word 'bellum' (war) because it became phonetically identical to 'bellus' (beautiful) in Vulgar Latin. To avoid confusion, speakers adopted the Frankish Germanic word '*werra,' which became 'guerre' in French, 'guerra' in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese."
