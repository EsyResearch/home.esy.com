## Research Methodology

All statistics and historical facts cross-referenced across multiple Tier 1 academic sources. Primary documents (Berlin Conference Act, Casement Report, Vernichtungsbefehl) consulted directly. Death toll estimates (Congo: 10 million; Herero genocide: 65,000) represent widely cited scholarly consensus from Hochschild and Olusoga & Erichsen respectively. Military engagement statistics verified through Vandervort's military history research.

The essay presents African resistance as the rule rather than exception, emphasizing Zulu, Ethiopian, and West African resistance movements. Border divisions and ethnic group splits documented through UNESCO's General History of Africa series.
