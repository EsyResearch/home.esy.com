## Key Facts Verification

### Ancient Origins
- **6000 BCE**: Earliest evidence of wine production (Georgia, Caucasus region)
- **PNAS 2017 study**: Chemical analysis of pottery residues confirms ancient wine
- **Neolithic period**: Wine production begins during agricultural revolution
- **Kvevri method**: Traditional Georgian clay vessels buried underground

### Archaeological Evidence
- **Georgia**: Earliest confirmed winemaking site (8,000 years ago)
- **Iran**: Hajji Firuz Tepe site shows wine from ~5400 BCE
- **Egypt**: Wine production documented in tomb paintings (~3000 BCE)
- **Greece & Rome**: Extensive written records and archaeological evidence

### Ancient Mediterranean
- **Phoenicians**: Spread viticulture across Mediterranean
- **Ancient Greeks**: Extensive wine culture, trading, symposia
- **Roman Empire**: Industrialized wine production, classification systems
- **Amphorae**: Clay vessels for wine storage and transport

### Wine Chemistry
- **Fermentation**: Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) converts sugars to alcohol
- **12-15% alcohol**: Typical wine alcohol content
- **Wild yeast**: Originally spontaneous fermentation
- **Tartaric acid**: Key marker for wine residue detection

### Viticulture Spread
- **Middle East origin**: Vitis vinifera domesticated in Caucasus/Near East
- **Mediterranean expansion**: Spread by Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans
- **Medieval Europe**: Monasteries preserve and advance winemaking
- **New World**: European colonization brings wine to Americas, Australia

### Monastic Preservation
- **Catholic Church**: Preserved winemaking knowledge through Middle Ages
- **Benedictine monks**: Developed viticulture techniques
- **Dom Pérignon**: Legendary monk (though champagne stories exaggerated)
- **Terroir concept**: Medieval development of vineyard classification

### Modern Wine Industry (OIV Statistics)
- **260 million hectoliters**: Annual global wine production (2020s)
- **7.4 billion gallons**: Equivalent measure
- **Top producers**: Italy, France, Spain
- **Top consumers**: United States, France, Italy
- **$300+ billion**: Global wine market value

### Wine Regions
- **Old World**: Europe, Mediterranean (France, Italy, Spain, Germany)
- **New World**: Americas, Australia, South Africa (California, Chile, Argentina, Australia)
- **Appellations**: Protected designation systems (DOC, AOC, AVA)

### Historical Phylloxera Epidemic
- **1860s-1870s**: Phylloxera insect devastates European vineyards
- **American rootstock**: Solution using resistant North American grape roots
- **Grafting**: European vines grafted onto American roots
- **Industry transformation**: Restructured global viticulture

### Wine Types
- **Red wine**: Fermented with grape skins (tannins, color)
- **White wine**: Fermented without skins
- **Rosé**: Limited skin contact
- **Sparkling**: Secondary fermentation (champagne method)
- **Fortified**: Added spirits (port, sherry)

## Research Methodology

Archaeological dating based on PNAS peer-reviewed research (2017 study confirming 6000 BCE Georgia wine production). Chemical analysis methodology verified through Penn Museum biomolecular archaeology research. Historical context cross-referenced with National Geographic and Smithsonian publications. Modern statistics from Organisation Internationale de la Vigne et du Vin (OIV) official data.

Ancient wine detection relies on tartaric acid residues in pottery, confirmed through multiple peer-reviewed archaeological studies. Timeline represents current scientific consensus from archaeological and historical sources.
