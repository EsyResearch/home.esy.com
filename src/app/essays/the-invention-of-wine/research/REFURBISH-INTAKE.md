### Design Extraction

#### Color Palette

| Variable | Value | Usage |
|----------|-------|-------|
| --wine-grape | #4A235A | Grape purple (early eras, left split) |
| --wine-young | #722F37 | Deep burgundy (primary accent, wine color) |
| --wine-aged | #8B4513 | Aged brick (later eras) |
| --wine-deep | #2C1810 | Near-black (backgrounds, footer) |
| --champagne | #F7E7CE | Light cream (text, highlights) |
| --cream | #FDF8F0 | Lighter cream (unused in current impl) |
| --cellar | #0D0D0D | Dark cellar black (main background) |
| --cork | #C4A35A | Cork gold (vat outline, stem) |

**Color Philosophy**: Wine aging progression (purple → burgundy → brick); cellar darkness aesthetic; champagne/cream for text contrast

#### Typography

| Element | Font Family | Size/Weight | Usage |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Display | Playfair Display | 400-700, italic variants | Headers, hero title, quotes, stats |
| Body | DM Sans | 300-500 | Body text, paragraphs, labels |

**Typography Philosophy**: Classical serif (Playfair) for elegance/history; clean sans (DM Sans) for readability

#### Animation Patterns

| Pattern | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Bottle Pour | scroll-driven | SVG bottle rotates 0-45° with scroll, wine level rises |
| Wine Stream | conditional | Ellipse appears when rotation >20°, grows with tilt |
| Fermentation Bubbles | infinite loop | 6 bubbles rise with staggered delays (4s cycle) |
| Wine Drop | infinite loop | Drip animation on hero scroll indicator (2s cycle) |
| Horizontal Timeline | scroll-driven | Timeline track translates -X based on section progress |
| Data Counter Reveal | intersection | Items scale from 0.8→1 and fade in with staggered delay |

#### Unique Visual Mechanics

1. **Pouring Bottle SVG**: Fixed background bottle that tilts and "pours" as user scrolls — unique to wine subject
2. **Fermentation Bubbles**: CO₂ bubbles rising in vat section — scientifically appropriate
3. **Grape → Wine Drop Transformation**: Visual metaphor of transformation central to story
4. **Horizontal Parallax Timeline**: Vertical scroll drives horizontal era progression
5. **Split Screen Contrast**: Purple (grape) vs burgundy (wine) for archaeological contrast
6. **Wine Stains**: Organic blob decorators (though minimally used)
7. **Cork Pop Reveal**: CSS prepared but not implemented in current version

#### Mobile Compliance Assessment

- [x] Mobile-first responsive (media queries at 768px)
- [x] Bottle animation hidden on mobile (good performance choice)
- [x] Split section stacks vertically
- [x] Data grid collapses to single column
- [ ] Horizontal timeline scroll may have mobile UX issues (needs testing)
- [x] Reduced motion respected

---

## Phase 2: Intent Inference

### Central Thesis

**"Wine is one of humanity's oldest and most civilized achievements—an 8,000-year journey from accidental discovery to global phenomenon, shaped by science, culture, and commerce."**

### Narrative Mode

- [x] **EDUCATOR** — Teaching the history and science of wine
- [x] **CELEBRATORY** — Appreciating wine's cultural significance
- [ ] STORYTELLER — Not character-driven
- [ ] INVESTIGATIVE — Not revealing hidden truths

**Primary Mode**: EDUCATOR with CELEBRATORY undertones

### Target Audience (Inferred)

- [x] **Curious generalists** — Primary audience
- [ ] Complete beginners — Too sophisticated for total novices
- [ ] Enthusiasts/experts — Not deep enough for sommeliers

**Evidence**:
- Accessible language without jargon
- Basic fermentation explanation (not assuming knowledge)
- High-level historical sweep vs. deep dives
- Data presented as impressive scale, not technical analysis

### Emotional Arc

**Opening** (Wonder): "Before writing. Before the wheel..." — establishes ancient mystery
↓
**Development** (Education): Fermentation science, historical timeline — knowledge transfer
↓
**Climax** (Scale): Archaeological extremes (700 jars, 1,700-year bottle) — awe at preservation
↓
**Resolution** (Appreciation): Hemingway quote, modern statistics — wine as civilized achievement

### Key Figures (Current Coverage)

| Figure | Role in Narrative | Current Depth |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| King Scorpion I | Archaeological evidence | Brief (1 sentence) |
| Dionysus/Bacchus | Religious significance | Brief (1 sentence) |
| Dom Pérignon | Monastic advancement | Brief mention |
| Ernest Hemingway | Literary perspective | Quote only |
| Pliny the Elder | Classical wisdom | Quote only |

**Gap**: No individual winemakers, scientists, or modern figures profiled

---

### Visual Intent Analysis

#### Visual Treatment Classification

- [ ] Photorealistic (archival photography, documentary)
- [x] **Illustrated** (SVG diagrams, original artwork)
- [ ] Data-driven (charts, visualizations)
- [ ] Mixed approach

**Primary**: Illustrated with inline SVG — bottle, grapes, vat, wine glass, drops

#### Era/Period Treatment

- **Color progression**: Purple (ancient) → Burgundy (classical) → Brick (medieval)
- **Background gradients** distinguish eras in horizontal timeline
- **Typography consistent** across all periods

#### Animation Philosophy

- [x] **Functional** (scroll-lock for focus, educational purpose)
- [ ] Subtle (micro-interactions)
- [ ] Dramatic (cinematic, bold transitions)

**Evidence**: Animations serve to illustrate content (bubbles = fermentation, pour = progression)

#### Subject-Design Alignment

**Assessment**: 9/10

**Evidence of Alignment**:
- Color palette directly derived from wine (grape purple, burgundy, aged brick)
- Animations are wine-specific (pour, bubbles, cork pop preparation)
- Typography evokes wine label elegance (Playfair Display)
- Dark "cellar" aesthetic appropriate to subject
- SVG illustrations are subject-derived (bottle, grape cluster, vat, glass)

**Minor Gaps**:
- Cork pop animation defined but not implemented
- Wine stains underutilized
- Could add more terroir/vineyard visual elements

| 6 | "10,000+ grape varieties" | Data | OIV or academic source |
| 7 | "7.4M hectares of vineyards" | Data | OIV statistics |

### Quote Verification Status

| # | Quote | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Hemingway quote | ✅ Verified (Death in the Afternoon, p.18) |
| 2 | "In vino veritas" | ✅ Verified (traditional Latin proverb) |

### Research Expansion Opportunities

Based on extracted content, research could expand:

1. **Additional Figures to Profile**:
   - Patrick McGovern (Penn Museum biomolecular archaeologist)
   - Louis Pasteur (fermentation science)
   - Robert Mondavi (New World revolution)
   - Widow Clicquot (champagne innovation)

2. **Events to Add Context**:
   - Phylloxera epidemic (1860s-1870s) — major historical drama
   - 1976 Judgment of Paris — New World disruption
   - Climate change effects on wine regions
   - Prohibition era (US and global)

3. **Data Visualizations to Create**:
   - Map: Ancient wine trade routes (Phoenician, Greek, Roman)
   - Map: Modern top wine-producing countries
   - Chart: Wine production by country/region
   - Timeline: Wine spread across continents

4. **Perspectives Currently Missing**:
   - Winemaking science (terroir, tannins, aging chemistry)
   - Wine regions deep dive (Bordeaux, Burgundy, Napa, etc.)
   - Religious significance (Eucharist, Jewish wine traditions)
   - Wine in literature and art beyond single quote
   - Women in wine history

### Design Assessment

#### Recommendation: **PRESERVE with DOCUMENTATION**

**Rationale**:
- Design is exceptional and subject-derived
- Unique visual mechanics (pour animation, bubbles) are wine-specific
- Color system directly from subject matter
- Typography appropriate to elegant/historical tone
- Mobile compliance acceptable
- Animation philosophy is functional/educational

#### No Redesign Needed Because:
- No quality failures
- Strong subject-design alignment (9/10)
- Unique visual identity achieved
- Anti-pattern conscious (documented in code comments)

#### Design Documentation Needed:
- Create DESIGN-RESEARCH.md to formalize existing choices
- Document color progression rationale
- Document animation patterns
- Document typography choices

#### Potential Design Extensions (for expanded content):
- New era colors if timeline extended beyond Medieval
- Map visualization styling (if adding trade routes)
- Figure portrait treatment (if adding profiles)
- Phylloxera visualization (if adding epidemic section)
