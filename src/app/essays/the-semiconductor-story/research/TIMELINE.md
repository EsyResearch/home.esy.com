## Detailed Events

### 1. First Transistor Demonstration (1947)

**Exact Dates**:
- **December 16, 1947**: First successful semiconductor amplifier created by Bardeen and Brattain
- **December 23, 1947**: Official demonstration to Bell Labs management
- **June 30, 1948**: Public announcement at press conference

**What Happened**:
Bardeen and Brattain applied two closely-spaced gold contacts held by a plastic wedge to high-purity germanium. The voltage on one contact modulated the current through the other, amplifying input signal up to 100x. Bell Labs engineer John Pierce named it "transistor."

**Significance**:
Replaced vacuum tubes as fundamental building block of electronics—smaller, more reliable, more energy-efficient. Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley shared 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics.
