# Research Gaps: The Semiconductor Story

> Research compiled: December 18, 2025
> Purpose: Document what could NOT be verified — claims to AVOID in final essay

---

## Critical Gaps (Do Not Claim)

### 1. Exact Transistor Counts for Unlisted Processors
**Gap**: Only verified transistor counts for processors explicitly listed in DATA.md
**Risk**: Fabricating counts for processors not in sources
**Mitigation**: Only cite counts from verified sources; use "approximately" for estimates

### 2. Future Process Node Timelines
**Gap**: 2nm and 1nm timelines are roadmap projections, not confirmed
**Risk**: Presenting future nodes as certain
**Mitigation**: Use language like "planned," "roadmap," "expected" for future nodes

### 3. Exact Market Share Percentages (Variance)
**Gap**: Different sources report slightly different market share figures
**Risk**: Claiming precision that doesn't exist
**Mitigation**: Use ranges or cite specific source; avoid mixing sources

### 4. ASML EUV Technical Specifications
**Gap**: Some EUV machine internal specifications are proprietary
**Risk**: Technical inaccuracies about lithography process
**Mitigation**: Use publicly available specifications only; acknowledge complexity

## Medium Gaps (Handle Carefully)

### 5. Jean Hoerni's Role in Planar Process
**Gap**: Limited direct quotes from Hoerni about planar process invention
**Risk**: Under-crediting or over-crediting his contribution
**Mitigation**: Credit planar process to Hoerni clearly; note Noyce built on it

### 6. Samsung's Semiconductor History Details
**Gap**: Less comprehensive English-language sources on Samsung's early semiconductor development
**Risk**: Under-representing Korean contribution
**Mitigation**: Note Samsung's importance without fabricating details

### 7. Japanese Semiconductor Decline Causes
**Gap**: Multiple competing explanations for Japan's semiconductor industry decline
**Risk**: Oversimplifying complex industrial dynamics
**Mitigation**: Present as multi-factor; avoid single-cause explanations

### 8. CHIPS Act Long-Term Impact
**Gap**: Too early to assess actual impact of CHIPS Act
**Risk**: Overstating proven results
**Mitigation**: Report announcements and investments; don't claim manufacturing has returned

## Minor Gaps (Note for Accuracy)

### 9. Exact Date Moore Revised His Law
**Gap**: 1975 revision to "every two years" — exact date/context less documented
**Risk**: Stating with false precision
**Mitigation**: Say "revised in 1975 at IEEE IEDM" without exact day

### 10. "Traitorous Eight" Name Origin
**Gap**: Whether Shockley actually used "traitorous" or it was attributed later
**Risk**: Presenting uncertain attribution as fact
**Mitigation**: Note the term became associated with them; don't attribute directly to Shockley

### 11. Photography Licensing for Specific Images
**Gap**: Haven't confirmed licensing terms for all archive images
**Risk**: Using images without proper rights
**Mitigation**: Image research phase must verify licensing before use

### 12. Carver Mead "Moore's Law" Coining
**Gap**: Exact date Carver Mead coined the term "Moore's Law" uncertain (c. 1970-1975)
**Risk**: False precision on term origin
**Mitigation**: Say "around 1970-1975" or "in the early 1970s"

## Topics Explicitly Out of Scope

These are not gaps but intentional exclusions:

1. **Detailed quantum mechanics** — beyond "electrons flow through" level
2. **Individual processor specifications** — beyond representative examples
3. **Financial/investment analysis** — stock prices, valuations
4. **Future predictions** — beyond established roadmaps
5. **Competitor analysis** — beyond historical context
6. **China's semiconductor industry details** — complex political topic requiring dedicated treatment

## Writer Guidance

### When You Don't Have a Source:
1. Check GAPS.md first
2. If topic is listed as gap, do not claim
3. If new gap discovered, add to GAPS.md
4. Use hedging language: "approximately," "according to," "around"

### When Sources Conflict:
1. Note the conflict in content
2. Cite the more authoritative source
3. Don't average conflicting numbers

### When Topic Is Out of Scope:
1. Acknowledge briefly if relevant
2. Don't fabricate details
3. Redirect to main narrative
