## Source Quality Assessment

### Tier Distribution
- **Tier 1 (Primary/Academic)**: Nobel Prize, IEEE, Computer History Museum, original papers, museum archives
- **Tier 2 (Major Publications)**: Intel official, Britannica, IEEE Spectrum, ASML, government sources
- **Tier 3 (Industry)**: WikiChip, TrendForce, industry blogs

### Key Strengths
- Bell Labs history well-documented with primary sources
- Fairchild/Intel founding has extensive oral histories
- Moore's Law original paper accessible
- Morris Chang oral histories comprehensive
- EUV development documented by ASML

### Areas of Caution (see GAPS.md)
- Future process node timelines (roadmap only)
- Exact market share figures vary by source
- Some ASML technical specs proprietary

## Narrative Arc Summary

### Act 1: The Invention (1947-1959)
Bell Labs invents the transistor → Shockley's failures → Traitorous Eight → IC invented

### Act 2: The Industry (1965-1987)
Moore's Law as prophecy → Grove transforms Intel → Chang creates foundry model

### Act 3: The Stakes (1987-Present)
Asian manufacturing rises → ASML achieves EUV → Supply chain revealed → CHIPS Act
