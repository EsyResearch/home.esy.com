## Research Notes

### Verification Status
All museum sources verified through institutional websites. Historical facts cross-referenced across multiple sources. Persian origins confirmed through Bata Shoe Museum and academic fashion history.

### Gender History
The gender shift in high heel wearing (men to women) occurred gradually during the Enlightenment (18th century), linked to changing concepts of masculinity and rationalism. Men's abandonment of ornate fashion is termed the "Great Male Renunciation."

### Louis XIV Evidence
Multiple contemporary paintings and written accounts confirm Louis XIV's heel wearing. The red heel decree is documented in French royal archives. His actual heel heights are preserved in museum collections.

### Stiletto Invention
Multiple designers claim stiletto invention in the 1950s. Roger Vivier and Salvatore Ferragamo both contributed innovations. The key technological advance was using steel reinforcement to support thin, high heels.

### Contemporary Debates
Modern feminist perspectives on high heels are complex:
- Empowerment through choice and aesthetics
- Critique of patriarchal beauty standards
- Workplace dress code controversies
- Body autonomy and self-expression
