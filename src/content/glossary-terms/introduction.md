# Introduction: Your Essay's First Impression

The introduction is your essay's opening paragraph that serves multiple crucial functions: engaging the reader, providing necessary background information, and presenting your thesis statement. A strong introduction sets the tone and direction for your entire essay.

## Purpose and Goals

### Engage the Reader
Capture attention with an interesting hook that makes readers want to continue.

### Provide Context
Give readers the background information they need to understand your topic and argument.

### Present Your Thesis
End with a clear, specific thesis statement that previews your main argument.

### Establish Tone
Set the appropriate academic tone and voice for your essay.

## The Introduction Funnel

Think of your introduction as moving from **general to specific**:

1. **Hook** (broad, attention-grabbing)
2. **Background** (narrowing focus)
3. **Thesis** (specific argument)

## Hook Strategies

### Statistical Hook
Start with a surprising or compelling statistic.

**Example**: "Every 11 minutes, a teenager in the United States attempts suicide—a rate that has increased 35% since social media became ubiquitous."

### Question Hook
Pose a thought-provoking question to your readers.

**Example**: "What if the tools designed to connect us are actually driving us apart?"

### Anecdotal Hook
Begin with a brief, relevant story or scenario.

**Example**: "Sarah checks her phone 150 times per day, often feeling anxious when she can't access Instagram for more than an hour."

### Quote Hook
Use a relevant quote from an expert or notable figure.

**Example**: "As psychologist Dr. Jean Twenge warns, 'We are on the brink of the worst mental health crisis in decades.'"

### Contradiction Hook
Present something that seems contradictory or surprising.

**Example**: "Despite being more connected than ever, teenagers report feeling lonelier than any previous generation."

## Background Information

### What to Include
- **Historical context** if relevant
- **Definitions** of key terms
- **Current situation** or scope of the problem
- **Why this topic matters** now

### What to Avoid
- **Too much detail** (save for body paragraphs)
- **Your personal opinion** (save for thesis)
- **Obvious information** everyone already knows
- **Irrelevant background** that doesn't connect to your thesis

## Example Introduction Breakdown

> **Hook**: "In the past decade, teenage depression rates have skyrocketed by 60%, coinciding with the rise of social media platforms designed to capture and monetize attention. **Background**: While social media promised to connect young people and provide new opportunities for self-expression, mounting evidence suggests these platforms may be causing more harm than good. Recent studies link excessive social media use to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and social isolation among adolescents. **Thesis**: Social media platforms should implement strict age verification and usage limits for users under 18 because current design features exploit teenage brain development, promote harmful social comparison, and interfere with essential developmental tasks."

### Analysis
- **Hook**: Statistical evidence that surprises readers
- **Background**: Provides context about social media's promises vs. reality
- **Thesis**: Clear, specific argument with three main points

## Common Introduction Mistakes

### Too Broad
❌ "Throughout history, humans have always communicated."
✅ "Social media has fundamentally changed how teenagers interact and perceive themselves."

### Dictionary Definition
❌ "According to Webster's dictionary, social media is..."
✅ Use more engaging hooks that assume readers understand basic terms.

### Announcing Your Intentions
❌ "In this essay, I will prove that..."
✅ Simply state your thesis confidently.

### Too Long
❌ Introductions longer than 10% of your total essay
✅ Keep introductions concise and focused.

### Weak Thesis Placement
❌ Burying your thesis in the middle of the introduction
✅ End with your thesis as the culminating statement.

## Length Guidelines

### Short Essays (3-5 pages)
- **3-5 sentences** or about 75-100 words
- One paragraph maximum

### Medium Essays (5-10 pages)
- **5-8 sentences** or about 100-150 words
- Still typically one paragraph

### Long Essays (10+ pages)
- **May extend to 2 paragraphs**
- First paragraph: hook and background
- Second paragraph: more context and thesis

## Revision Checklist

- [ ] Does my hook engage readers immediately?
- [ ] Is my background information relevant and necessary?
- [ ] Does my thesis clearly state my argument?
- [ ] Do all parts connect logically?
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for my audience?
- [ ] Does it preview what's coming in my essay?

## Tips for Success

1. **Write your introduction last** - after you know exactly what you're arguing
2. **Read it aloud** - does it flow smoothly?
3. **Show it to someone else** - do they want to keep reading?
4. **Revise multiple times** - introductions often need several drafts

Remember: Your introduction is a promise to your reader about what your essay will deliver. Make sure you can fulfill that promise in your body paragraphs!
