A quote is the exact words from a source, placed in quotation marks and properly cited. Quoting preserves the original author's precise language.

## When to Quote

- The exact wording is important or memorable
- You're analyzing the author's specific language
- The source says it better than you could paraphrase
- You need to establish credibility with expert language

## Quote Sandwich

1. **Introduce** — signal phrase with context
2. **Quote** — the exact words in quotation marks
3. **Explain** — analyze what it means

## Examples

**Short quote (under 4 lines):**
According to Smith, "social media fundamentally alters adolescent brain development" (45).

**Long quote (4+ lines in MLA):**
Block indent without quotation marks, citation after period.

## Formatting Rules

| Length | Format |
|--------|--------|
| Under 4 lines | Integrate in paragraph with quotation marks |
| 4+ lines (MLA) | Block indent, no quotation marks |
| 40+ words (APA) | Block indent, no quotation marks |

## Common Mistakes

- Quoting too much (paraphrase instead)
- Dropping quotes without introduction
- Not explaining the quote's significance
- Missing or incorrect citations

> Use quotes sparingly. If you can paraphrase effectively, do so. Quote only when the exact words matter.

## Quick Tip

After every quote, ask yourself: "So what?" Then write that explanation.
