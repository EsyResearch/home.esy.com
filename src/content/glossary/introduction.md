The introduction is your essay's opening paragraph. It engages the reader, provides context, and presents your thesis statement.

## The Introduction Funnel

Move from general to specific:

1. **Hook** — grab attention with a surprising fact, question, or anecdote
2. **Background** — provide context readers need
3. **Thesis** — state your main argument

## Hook Types

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Statistic | "Every 11 minutes, a teenager attempts suicide..." |
| Question | "What if the tools designed to connect us are driving us apart?" |
| Anecdote | "Sarah checks her phone 150 times per day..." |
| Quote | "As experts warn, 'We face a mental health crisis...'" |

## Common Mistakes

- **Too broad** — "Throughout history, humans have always communicated"
- **Dictionary definition** — "According to Webster's..."
- **Announcing** — "In this essay, I will prove..."
- **Weak thesis placement** — burying your thesis in the middle

> Keep your introduction to about 10% of your total essay length.

## Quick Tips

- Write your introduction last (after you know your argument)
- End with your thesis as the culminating statement
- Make readers want to continue reading
