Body paragraphs are the building blocks of your essay where you develop your argument. Each paragraph should focus on one main idea and provide evidence with analysis.

## The PIE Structure

- **P — Point** (Topic Sentence): State your main claim
- **I — Information** (Evidence): Support with facts, quotes, or examples
- **E — Explanation** (Analysis): Explain how evidence supports your argument

## Example

**Topic Sentence:** "Social media algorithms exploit psychological vulnerabilities to maximize engagement."

**Evidence:** "Research shows platforms use 'variable ratio reinforcement'—the same mechanism found in gambling—to keep users scrolling (Lembke, 2021)."

**Analysis:** "This deliberate design choice shows platforms prioritize profit over user well-being, supporting the need for regulation."

## Essential Components

1. **Topic sentence** — introduces the paragraph's main idea
2. **Context** — provides background for evidence
3. **Evidence** — supports your claim
4. **Analysis** — explains significance
5. **Transition** — connects to next paragraph

> A strong body paragraph is like a mini-essay with its own claim, evidence, and analysis.

## Quick Tips

- Start with a clear topic sentence
- Include multiple types of evidence
- Always explain *why* evidence matters
- Link back to your thesis
