Subject-verb agreement means the subject and verb in a sentence must both be singular or both be plural.

## Basic Rule

| Subject | Verb |
|---------|------|
| Singular (he, she, it) | Singular verb (writes, runs, is) |
| Plural (they, we) | Plural verb (write, run, are) |

## Common Tricky Cases

**Words between subject and verb:**
- ❌ "The list of items are long."
- ✓ "The list of items is long." (list = singular)

**Compound subjects with "and":**
- ✓ "The professor and the student are meeting."

**Either/or, neither/nor:**
- ✓ "Neither the students nor the teacher was prepared." (verb matches closest subject)

**Collective nouns:**
- ✓ "The team is winning." (group acting as one)
- ✓ "The team are arguing." (individuals within group)

## Examples

**Indefinite pronouns (each, everyone, nobody):**
- ❌ "Everyone have their books."
- ✓ "Everyone has their books."

**Inverted sentences:**
- ❌ "There is many reasons."
- ✓ "There are many reasons."

> When in doubt, identify the true subject and ignore phrases between it and the verb.

## Quick Tip

Mentally remove prepositional phrases to find the real subject: "The box [of chocolates] is empty."
