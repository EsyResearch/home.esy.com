A hook is the opening of your essay designed to grab readers' attention and make them want to continue reading. It's the front door to your argument.

## Types of Hooks

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Startling statistic** | Data-driven arguments |
| **Provocative question** | Engaging reader directly |
| **Vivid anecdote** | Humanizing abstract issues |
| **Striking quote** | Borrowing authority |
| **Contradiction** | Challenging assumptions |

## Examples

**Statistic:** "Every 11 minutes, a teenager attempts suicide in the United States—a rate that has increased 56% since 2007."

**Question:** "What if the very technology designed to connect us is actually driving us apart?"

**Anecdote:** "Maya had always been a straight-A student until her junior year, when her grades began slipping as she spent more time crafting the perfect Instagram posts."

## Common Mistakes

- **Too broad** — "Throughout history, people have always..."
- **Dictionary definition** — "According to Merriam-Webster..."
- **Clichéd** — "In today's society..." or "Since the beginning of time..."
- **Irrelevant** — Not connecting to your actual argument

> You have about 30 seconds to capture your reader's attention. Make it count.

## Quick Tips

- Match your hook to your essay's tone
- Ensure it connects to your thesis
- Be specific rather than general
- Test it: Would *you* want to keep reading?
