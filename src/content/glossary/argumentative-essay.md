An argumentative essay presents a clear position on a debatable issue and supports it with evidence, reasoning, and analysis. The goal is to persuade readers to accept your viewpoint.

## Key Components

- **Clear thesis** — a debatable claim
- **Strong evidence** — facts, statistics, expert opinions
- **Counterarguments** — addressed and refuted
- **Logical organization** — structured flow of ideas

## Basic Structure

1. **Introduction** — hook, background, thesis
2. **Body paragraphs** — claim, evidence, analysis
3. **Counterargument** — acknowledge and refute opposition
4. **Conclusion** — restate thesis, broader significance

## Example Thesis

**Weak:** "School uniforms are good."

**Strong:** "School uniforms should be mandatory because they reduce bullying, promote equality, and improve academic focus."

## Argumentative Strategies

| Strategy | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Logos** | Appeal to logic with evidence and reasoning |
| **Ethos** | Establish credibility through sources |
| **Pathos** | Appeal to emotions (use sparingly) |

> An argumentative essay isn't about "winning"—it's about making a convincing, evidence-based case.

## Quick Tips

- Choose a topic you can actually argue (not just a fact)
- Use evidence from credible sources
- Address the strongest counterarguments
- Maintain a respectful, confident tone
