An outline is a structured plan that organizes your ideas before you begin writing. It's the blueprint for your essay—showing where everything goes and how pieces fit together.

## Why Outline?

- **Clarifies thinking** — forces logical organization
- **Prevents writer's block** — provides a clear path
- **Saves time** — reduces major revisions
- **Strengthens arguments** — reveals gaps in reasoning

## Basic Structure

```
I. Introduction
   - Hook
   - Background
   - Thesis

II. Body Paragraph 1
   - Topic sentence
   - Evidence
   - Analysis

III. Body Paragraph 2
   - Topic sentence
   - Evidence
   - Analysis

IV. Conclusion
   - Thesis restatement
   - Summary
   - Broader significance
```

## Outline Types

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Topic** | Quick organization with keywords |
| **Sentence** | Detailed planning with full sentences |
| **Alphanumeric** | Formal structure (I, A, 1, a) |
