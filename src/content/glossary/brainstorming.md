Brainstorming is the creative process of generating ideas, exploring possibilities, and discovering connections before you begin writing.

## Techniques

| Method | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Freewriting** | Write continuously for 10-15 minutes without stopping |
| **Mind mapping** | Create a visual diagram with your topic at the center |
| **Listing** | Make lists of ideas, examples, and questions |
| **Questioning** | Ask Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How |
| **Clustering** | Group related ideas to find patterns |

## The 5 W's + H

- **Who** is affected by this issue?
- **What** are the main problems or benefits?
- **When** did this become an issue?
- **Where** is this most relevant?
- **Why** is this important?
- **How** can this be addressed?

## Common Mistakes

- Stopping too early (keep going until you exhaust ideas)
- Judging ideas too soon (write everything down first)
- Being too linear (focus on quantity, organize later)
- Working alone (try collaborative brainstorming)

> Effective brainstorming isn't about finding the "right" idea—it's about exploring possibilities.
