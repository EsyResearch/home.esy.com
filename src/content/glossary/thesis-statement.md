A thesis statement is a sentence that presents the central argument or claim of your essay. It appears at the end of your introduction and guides everything that follows.

## Characteristics of a Strong Thesis

- **Specific** — clearly states what the essay will discuss
- **Arguable** — presents a debatable position
- **Focused** — addresses one main idea
- **Clear** — uses precise language

## Placement

The thesis typically appears as the last sentence of your introduction, serving as a bridge between your hook/background and your body paragraphs.

## Example

**Weak:**
"Social media is bad for teenagers."

**Strong:**
"Excessive social media use negatively impacts teenage sleep patterns, academic performance, and face-to-face social skills."

> The strong version is specific, arguable, and previews three supporting points.

## Quick Tips

- Make sure your thesis can be debated
- Avoid vague words like "good," "bad," or "interesting"
- Include a roadmap of your main points
- Revise your thesis as your essay develops
