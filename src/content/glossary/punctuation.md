Punctuation marks are symbols that clarify meaning, indicate pauses, and organize text. They help readers understand your intended meaning.

## Common Marks

| Mark | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **.** Period | Ends declarative sentences |
| **,** Comma | Separates items, indicates pauses |
| **;** Semicolon | Connects related independent clauses |
| **:** Colon | Introduces lists or explanations |
| **'** Apostrophe | Shows possession or contractions |
| **"** Quotation marks | Indicates direct speech or titles |

## Comma Rules

- **Lists:** pencils, paper, and books
- **Introductory phrases:** After the lecture, students asked questions.
- **Compound sentences:** I write essays, and my professor grades them.
- **Nonessential info:** My professor, who has a PhD, teaches writing.

## Semicolon vs. Comma

- **Semicolon:** Connects two complete, related sentences
- **Comma + conjunction:** Connects two complete sentences with "and," "but," etc.

**Example:**
- I love writing; it helps me think clearly.
- I love writing, and it helps me think clearly.

> Punctuation is the traffic signal of writing—it tells readers when to pause, stop, or continue.

## Quick Tips

- When in doubt, keep sentences shorter
- Read aloud to hear natural pauses
- Use the Oxford comma for clarity
- Don't overuse exclamation points
