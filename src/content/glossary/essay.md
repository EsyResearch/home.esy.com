An essay is a short prose composition in which a writer explores a subject through their own perspective. Unlike a report (which presents information objectively) or a story (which dramatizes events), an essay filters its subject through a particular mind—interpreting, questioning, and making meaning.

## Etymology

The word comes from the French *essai*, meaning "attempt" or "trial." Michel de Montaigne coined the term in 1580 for his *Essais*, emphasizing that his writings were experiments in thinking—attempts to understand, not final pronouncements.

## Essay Types

| Type | Purpose | Key Feature |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Argumentative** | Defends a position | Takes a stance, uses evidence |
| **Expository** | Explains a concept | Informs objectively |
| **Narrative** | Tells a story | Personal experience, chronological |
| **Descriptive** | Creates a picture | Sensory details, imagery |
| **Analytical** | Examines something | Breaks down into parts |

## Essay vs. Article vs. Paper

| Feature | Essay | Article | Paper |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| Voice | Personal, distinctive | Objective, institutional | Formal, academic |
| Purpose | Explore, interpret | Inform, report | Argue, prove |
| Evidence | Experience, observation | Facts, interviews | Data, citations |
| Structure | Flexible, organic | Formula-driven | Highly structured |

## Basic Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Introduction** | Hook reader, provide context, state thesis |
| **Body Paragraphs** | Present evidence and analysis (one idea per paragraph) |
| **Conclusion** | Synthesize ideas, reinforce thesis, leave lasting impression |

## Key Elements

1. **Thesis statement** — your central claim or argument
2. **Topic sentences** — main idea of each paragraph
3. **Evidence** — facts, quotes, examples that support your points
4. **Analysis** — explanation of why evidence matters
5. **Transitions** — connections between ideas
6. **Voice** — your distinctive perspective on the subject

## Common Mistakes

- **Treating "essay" as synonym for "assignment"** — Not every written assignment is an essay in form
- **No clear thesis** — Wandering without a central argument
- **Summary without analysis** — Describing what happened without explaining why it matters
- **Missing transitions** — Jumping between ideas without connections

> An essay is not a container for information—it's a record of a mind at work.

## Quick Tips

- Before drafting, ask: What am I trying to figure out? That question drives the essay
- State your thesis clearly at the end of your introduction
- Each body paragraph should make one point that supports your thesis
- Read your essay aloud—if it sounds choppy, add transitions
