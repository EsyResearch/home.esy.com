A bibliography is a list of all sources cited or consulted during research. It appears at the end of your paper and provides complete publication information.

## Types

| Type | Contents |
|------|----------|
| **Works Cited** (MLA) | Only sources directly cited |
| **References** (APA) | Sources cited in the paper |
| **Bibliography** | All sources consulted, cited or not |
| **Annotated** | Includes brief descriptions of each source |

## Formatting Rules

- Alphabetize by author's last name
- Use hanging indent (first line flush, subsequent indented)
- Double-space entries
- Follow your citation style consistently

## Examples

Smith, John. "Social Media Impact." *Journal of Communication*, vol. 15, no. 3, 2020, pp. 42-58.

**APA:**
Smith, J. (2020). Social media impact. *Journal of Communication*, 15(3), 42-58.

**Chicago:**
