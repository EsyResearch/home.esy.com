Plagiarism is using someone else's work, ideas, or words without giving proper credit. It's a serious academic offense that can result in failing grades or expulsion.

## Types of Plagiarism

- **Direct** — copying text word-for-word without quotes
- **Paraphrasing** — rewriting ideas without citation
- **Self-plagiarism** — reusing your own previous work without permission
- **Accidental** — unintentional failure to cite sources
- **Mosaic** — piecing together phrases from different sources

## How to Avoid It

1. Always cite sources for borrowed ideas
2. Use quotation marks for direct quotes
3. Paraphrase properly *and* cite the original
4. Keep detailed notes during research
5. Use plagiarism detection tools before submitting

## Example

**Original:** "Social media has transformed how teenagers communicate."

**Plagiarized:** Social media has transformed how teenagers communicate.

**Proper:** According to Smith (2020), social media has transformed how teenagers communicate.

> When in doubt, cite it out.

## Quick Tips

- Start citing from the moment you begin research
- Keep a running bibliography
- Understand what counts as "common knowledge"
- Ask your instructor if you're unsure
