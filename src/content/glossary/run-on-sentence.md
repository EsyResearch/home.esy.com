A run-on sentence occurs when two or more independent clauses are joined without proper punctuation or conjunctions.

## Types

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Fused sentence** | I wrote the essay I submitted it late. |
| **Comma splice** | I wrote the essay, I submitted it late. |

## How to Fix Run-ons

1. **Add a period:** "I wrote the essay. I submitted it late."
2. **Add a semicolon:** "I wrote the essay; I submitted it late."
3. **Add a conjunction:** "I wrote the essay, but I submitted it late."
4. **Subordinate one clause:** "Although I wrote the essay, I submitted it late."

## Examples

**Run-on:** "The research was extensive it took three months to complete."

**Fixed options:**
- "The research was extensive. It took three months to complete."
- "The research was extensive; it took three months to complete."
- "The research was extensive, and it took three months to complete."

> Long sentences aren't automatically run-ons. The issue is missing punctuation between independent clauses, not length.

## Quick Tip

Read your sentence aloud. If you naturally pause between two complete thoughts but there's no punctuation, you may have a run-on.
