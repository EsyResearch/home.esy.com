Evidence consists of facts, data, examples, and expert opinions that support your claims. Without strong evidence, arguments become mere opinions.

## Types of Evidence

- **Statistical** — numerical data and research findings
- **Expert testimony** — opinions from recognized authorities
- **Anecdotal** — personal stories and specific examples
- **Historical** — past events and established patterns
- **Case studies** — detailed analysis of specific examples

## Evaluating Quality

| Criteria | Question to Ask |
|----------|-----------------|
| Authority | Is the source reputable? |
| Recency | Is the information current? |
| Objectivity | Is the source free from bias? |
| Accuracy | Can the information be verified? |

## The Quote Sandwich

1. **Introduce** the source and context
2. **Present** the quote or data
3. **Analyze** its significance

> Evidence without analysis is just information. Always explain *why* it matters.

## Example

**Weak:** "A study shows 78% of teens use social media daily."

**Strong:** "According to a 2023 Pew Research study, 78% of teens use social media daily—a rate that has more than doubled since 2012, suggesting a fundamental shift in how adolescents communicate (Smith, 2023)."

## Quick Tips

- Use multiple types of evidence
- Always cite your sources
- Explain how evidence supports your claim
- Choose quality over quantity
