Proofreading is the final stage of the writing process, focusing on catching surface-level errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and formatting.

## Proofreading vs. Revision

| Revision | Proofreading |
|----------|--------------|
| Done early and often | Done last |
| Focuses on content and structure | Focuses on surface errors |
| May involve major changes | Minor corrections only |

## What to Check

- **Spelling** — especially commonly confused words
- **Grammar** — subject-verb agreement, tense consistency
- **Punctuation** — commas, apostrophes, quotation marks
- **Formatting** — margins, font, spacing, citations
- **Typos** — missing or repeated words

## Proofreading Strategies

- **Read slowly** — or read aloud
- **Read backwards** — start from the end to focus on words, not meaning
- **Use a pointer** — finger or pen to track each word
- **Change the format** — print it out or change the font
- **Take breaks** — fresh eyes catch more errors

## Common Errors to Watch

- Their/there/they're
- Its/it's
- Your/you're
- Affect/effect
- Missing words
- Double words

> Proofread when you're alert, not tired. Your brain will autocorrect errors if you're rushing.

## Quick Tip

Read your paper aloud slowly. Your ear will catch errors your eyes miss.
