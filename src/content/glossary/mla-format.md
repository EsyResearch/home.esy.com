# MLA Format: The Humanities Standard

MLA (Modern Language Association) format is the standard citation style for papers in literature, arts, and humanities. It emphasizes the author and page number for easy reference to printed sources.

## When to Use MLA

### Academic Disciplines
- **Literature** and literary analysis
- **Foreign languages** and linguistics
- **Philosophy** and ethics
- **Art history** and criticism
- **Cultural studies**
- **Some history** courses

### Key Features
- **Author-page** in-text citations
- **Works Cited** page (not "References")
- **Present tense** for discussing literature
- **Minimal punctuation** in citations

## Basic Paper Format

### Header and Heading
```
Your Name
Professor's Name
Course Name
Date

Title of Your Paper
```

### Page Setup
- **12-point Times New Roman** font
- **Double-spaced** throughout
- **1-inch margins** on all sides
- **Page numbers** in top right corner
- **Last name** before page number

## In-Text Citations

### Basic Format
**(Author Page)**

**Examples:**
- One author: (Smith 45)
- Two authors: (Smith and Jones 23)
- Three+ authors: (Smith et al. 67)
- No author: ("Climate Change" 12)

### Integration Examples

**Direct Quote:**
> According to researcher Jane Smith, "social media fundamentally alters teenage brain development" (45).

**Paraphrase:**
> Recent studies suggest that adolescent neural pathways are significantly impacted by social media usage (Smith 45).

**Quote with Signal Phrase:**
> Smith argues that "teenage brains are particularly vulnerable to social media manipulation" (45).

## Works Cited Page

### Basic Template
**Author Last, First. "Title of Article." *Title of Source*, Publisher, Date, URL.**

### Common Source Types

**Book:**
```
Smith, John. The Digital Generation. Academic Press, 2023.
```

**Journal Article:**
```
Johnson, Sarah. "Teen Mental Health Crisis." Journal of Adolescent Psychology, vol. 15, no. 3, 2023, pp. 45-67.
```

**Website Article:**
```
Brown, Maria. "Social Media and Sleep." Health Today, 15 Jan. 2023, www.healthtoday.com/social-media-sleep.
```

**Newspaper Article:**
```
Davis, Robert. "Schools Ban Phones." New York Times, 20 Mar. 2023, p. A1.
```

**Online Video:**
```
TED. "The Danger of Social Media." YouTube, 10 Feb. 2023, www.youtube.com/watch?v=example.
```

## Special Situations

### Multiple Works by Same Author
Use shortened title in subsequent citations:
- First: (Smith, "Digital Generation" 45)
- Later: (Smith, "Digital" 67)

### No Page Numbers (Online Sources)
Use paragraph numbers if available:
- (Smith, par. 3)
- If no paragraphs: (Smith)

### Indirect Sources
When quoting someone quoted in your source:
- (qtd. in Smith 45)

### Block Quotes (4+ lines)
```
Smith makes a compelling argument about teenage social media use:

     Social media platforms deliberately design features to maximize 
     engagement, often at the expense of user well-being. The constant 
     stream of notifications, likes, and comments creates a dopamine-driven 
     cycle that can be particularly harmful to developing adolescent brains. (45)
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Citation Errors
- **Missing page numbers** for print sources
- **Incorrect punctuation** (periods outside parentheses)
- **URLs in in-text citations** (only in Works Cited)
- **Inconsistent formatting** between citations

### Works Cited Issues
- **Alphabetical order** by author's last name
- **Hanging indent** for each entry
- **Italics vs. quotes** (italics for longer works, quotes for shorter)
- **Missing access dates** for websites (if required)

## Quick Reference Checklist

### Before Submitting
- [ ] All in-text citations have corresponding Works Cited entries
- [ ] Works Cited is alphabetized by author's last name
- [ ] Proper hanging indent on Works Cited page
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout
- [ ] Page numbers in top right corner
- [ ] Double-spaced with 12-point Times New Roman

### MLA 9 Updates
- **Containers**: Use for complex sources (Netflix, databases)
- **URLs**: Include for online sources
- **DOIs**: Preferred over URLs when available
- **Access dates**: Only when required by instructor

## Tools and Resources

### Citation Generators
- **Purdue OWL** (most reliable)
- **EasyBib** (basic citations)
- **Zotero** (research management)

### Verification
Always double-check generated citations against official MLA guidelinesâ€”automated tools can make mistakes.

Remember: MLA format prioritizes clarity and consistency. When in doubt, consult the MLA Handbook or your instructor's specific requirements.
