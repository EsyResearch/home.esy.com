A research question is a focused, specific question that guides your research process and helps develop your thesis statement.

## Characteristics of Good Research Questions

- **Focused** — narrow enough to answer thoroughly
- **Complex** — requires analysis, not just facts
- **Debatable** — has multiple possible answers
- **Relevant** — matters to your field or audience

## Weak vs. Strong Questions

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| What is social media? | How does social media affect teen mental health? |
| Is climate change real? | What policies most effectively reduce carbon emissions? |
| When was the Civil War? | How did economic factors contribute to the Civil War? |

## Developing Your Question

1. **Start broad:** What topic interests you?
2. **Narrow down:** What specific aspect?
3. **Add complexity:** What, how, or why questions
4. **Test it:** Is it researchable and arguable?

## Types of Research Questions

- **Descriptive:** What is happening?
- **Comparative:** How do X and Y differ?
- **Causal:** What causes X? What are the effects?
- **Evaluative:** Is X effective? Which approach is better?

> Your research question should lead to a thesis statement that takes a position.

## Example Evolution

- **Too broad:** "What about education?"
- **Narrower:** "What about online education?"
- **Focused:** "How does online learning affect student engagement in introductory courses?"
