Passive voice is when the subject of a sentence receives the action rather than performing it. The actor may be omitted or placed after the verb.

## Structure

**Active:** Subject + Verb + Object
**Passive:** Object + "to be" + Past Participle (+ by Subject)

## Examples

| Active | Passive |
|--------|---------|
| The scientist discovered the cure. | The cure was discovered by the scientist. |
| Someone stole the car. | The car was stolen. |
| We will complete the project. | The project will be completed. |

## When to Use Passive Voice

- **Unknown actor:** "The window was broken."
- **Emphasizing the action:** "The experiment was conducted three times."
- **Scientific writing:** "The samples were analyzed."
- **Diplomatic language:** "Mistakes were made."

## When to Avoid It

- When it obscures responsibility
- When it makes sentences wordy
- When active voice would be clearer

> Use passive voice intentionally, not by default. Most sentences are stronger in active voice.

## Quick Test

If you can add "by zombies" after the verb and it makes sense, it's passive voice.
- "The report was written [by zombies]." ✓ Passive
