Sentence structure refers to how words are organized to create complete, grammatically correct sentences. Varying your sentence structure makes writing more engaging.

## Sentence Types

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Simple** | One independent clause | The student writes essays. |
| **Compound** | Two+ independent clauses | The student writes, and the teacher grades. |
| **Complex** | Independent + dependent clause | When the student writes, the teacher grades. |
| **Compound-Complex** | Multiple independent + dependent | When class ends, students leave, and teachers prepare. |

## Key Components

- **Subject** — who or what the sentence is about
- **Verb** — the action or state of being
- **Object** — receives the action
- **Modifiers** — adjectives, adverbs, phrases that add detail

## Variety Matters

**Monotonous:**
"Social media is popular. It affects teenagers. They use it daily. It causes problems."

**Varied:**
"Social media, which has become incredibly popular, affects teenagers who use it daily. This constant usage causes significant problems."

> Varying sentence length and structure keeps readers engaged.

## Quick Tips

- Mix short and long sentences
- Start sentences differently (not always with "The" or "I")
- Use complex sentences for sophisticated ideas
- Keep subject and verb close together for clarity
