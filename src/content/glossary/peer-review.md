Peer review is the process of having classmates, colleagues, or experts evaluate your writing and provide constructive feedback before final submission.

## Benefits

- **Fresh perspective** — others see what you miss
- **Identifies gaps** — reveals unclear or underdeveloped areas
- **Improves arguments** — tests if your logic is convincing
- **Catches errors** — finds typos and grammatical issues

## How to Give Good Feedback

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific and constructive | Be vague ("This is confusing") |
| Focus on major issues first | Nitpick minor details only |
| Suggest solutions | Just point out problems |
| Ask clarifying questions | Assume you understand intent |

## How to Receive Feedback

- Listen without defending
- Ask clarifying questions
- Take notes
- Consider all feedback, but make your own decisions
- Thank your reviewers

## Key Questions for Reviewers

- Is the thesis clear and arguable?
- Does the evidence support the claims?
- Is the organization logical?
- Are there gaps in the argument?
- Is the conclusion effective?

> Good peer review focuses on higher-order concerns (argument, structure, evidence) before lower-order concerns (grammar, spelling).

## Quick Tip

Give your reviewer specific questions: "Is my counterargument convincing?" works better than "What do you think?"
