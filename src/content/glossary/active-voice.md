Active voice is when the subject of a sentence performs the action expressed by the verb. It creates clearer, more direct writing.

## Active vs. Passive

| Voice | Structure | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Active** | Subject → Verb → Object | The researcher conducted the study. |
| **Passive** | Object → Verb → Subject | The study was conducted by the researcher. |

## Why Use Active Voice?

- **Clarity** — readers know who's doing what
- **Conciseness** — fewer words needed
- **Engagement** — feels more direct and dynamic
- **Accountability** — clearly assigns responsibility

## Examples

**Passive:** "The essay was written by the student."
**Active:** "The student wrote the essay."

**Passive:** "Mistakes were made."
**Active:** "The team made mistakes."

> Active voice makes your writing stronger and more engaging. Use it as your default.

## When Passive is Acceptable

- When the actor is unknown or unimportant
- In scientific writing when emphasizing the action
- When you want to avoid assigning blame
