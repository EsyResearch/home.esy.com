Analysis is the process of breaking down information and explaining what it means. Unlike summary (which tells *what* something says), analysis explains *why* it matters, *how* it works, or *what* it reveals.

## Summary vs. Analysis

- **Summary** describes what happened
- **Analysis** explains why it matters

## The Analysis Formula

1. **Present** your evidence clearly
2. **Explain** what it means
3. **Connect** it to your argument
4. **Explore** broader implications

> Good analysis answers the "So what?" question—it helps readers understand why the evidence matters.

## Example

**Weak (Summary only):**
"The study shows social media use increased among teens."

**Strong (With Analysis):**
"This 40% increase in teen social media use is significant because it coincides with rising anxiety rates, suggesting a potential causal relationship that warrants further investigation."

## Quick Tips

- Ask "why does this matter?" after every piece of evidence
- Connect evidence to your thesis
- Consider alternative interpretations
- Explain the significance, don't assume readers will see it
