A topic sentence is the first sentence of a body paragraph. It introduces the paragraph's main idea and connects it to your thesis.

## Formula

**Topic Sentence = Transition + Claim + Preview**

**Example:** "Furthermore, social media platforms increase teenage anxiety through algorithmic content that promotes unrealistic comparisons."

- *Transition:* "Furthermore"
- *Claim:* "social media platforms increase teenage anxiety"
- *Preview:* "through algorithmic content"

## Characteristics

- **Specific** — focuses on one idea
- **Debatable** — makes a claim, not just states a fact
- **Connected** — relates back to your thesis

## Weak vs. Strong

**Weak:** "Social media has many effects."
*(Too vague, not debatable)*

**Strong:** "Social media platforms increase anxiety among teenagers through constant social comparison."
*(Specific, arguable, focused)*

## Common Patterns

- **Cause/Effect:** "The rise of standardized testing has led to..."
- **Comparison:** "Unlike traditional learning, online education..."
- **Problem/Solution:** "To address the crisis, schools must..."

> Think of topic sentences as mini-thesis statements for each paragraph.

## Quick Tips

- Place at the beginning of each body paragraph
- Use transition words to connect paragraphs
- Ensure you can support the claim with evidence
