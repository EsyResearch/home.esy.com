Transitions are the bridges between your ideas—words and phrases that help readers follow your logic and understand how your thoughts connect.

## Types of Transitions

| Purpose | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Addition** | Furthermore, Moreover, Additionally, Also |
| **Contrast** | However, Nevertheless, On the other hand, Yet |
| **Cause/Effect** | Therefore, Consequently, As a result, Thus |
| **Sequence** | First, Second, Next, Finally |
| **Example** | For example, For instance, Specifically |
| **Emphasis** | Indeed, In fact, Most importantly |
| **Summary** | In conclusion, To summarize, Overall |

## Examples

**Addition:** "Social media increases anxiety. *Furthermore*, it disrupts sleep patterns."

**Contrast:** "Social media can connect people. *However*, it often isolates users from immediate communities."

**Cause/Effect:** "Teenagers spend 7+ hours daily on social media. *As a result*, they have less time for homework."

## Common Mistakes

- **Overuse** — too many transitions feels clunky
- **Misleading** — using "however" when you're not contrasting
- **Missing** — jumping between ideas without connection

> Good transitions guide readers without being noticeable.

## Quick Tips

- Use transitions at paragraph beginnings
- Match the transition to the relationship between ideas
- Vary your transitions—don't repeat "furthermore" constantly
- Sometimes a well-placed pronoun or repeated word works better
