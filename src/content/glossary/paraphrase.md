Paraphrasing is restating someone else's ideas in your own words while maintaining the original meaning. It's essential for integrating sources naturally and demonstrating your understanding.

## The Process

1. **Read** the original carefully
2. **Put it aside** — don't look while paraphrasing
3. **Restate** in your own words and structure
4. **Compare** to ensure meaning is preserved
5. **Cite** the source

## Techniques

- **Synonym substitution** — replace words with equivalents
- **Sentence restructuring** — change the order and structure
- **Voice change** — switch between active and passive
- **Combining ideas** — merge or split sentences

## Example

**Original:** "Social media platforms deliberately design features that exploit psychological vulnerabilities to maximize user engagement."

**Paraphrase:** "Social media companies intentionally create elements that take advantage of mental weaknesses to increase user participation" (Smith 45).

## Common Mistakes

- **Patchwriting** — only changing a few words
- **Losing meaning** — altering the original idea
- **Forgetting to cite** — paraphrases still need citations
- **Over-complicating** — making it unnecessarily wordy

> Paraphrasing shows you understand the source, not just that you can copy it.

## Quick Tips

- Use completely different sentence structure
- Maintain the original emphasis
- Keep technical terms when necessary
- Always cite, even for paraphrases
