Parallel structure (or parallelism) means using the same grammatical pattern for similar elements in a sentence. It creates rhythm and clarity.

## The Rule

Elements that are alike in function should be alike in construction.

## Examples

| Not Parallel | Parallel |
|--------------|----------|
| She likes reading, to write, and swimming. | She likes reading, writing, and swimming. |
| The study was quick, efficient, and cost little. | The study was quick, efficient, and inexpensive. |
| He promised to work harder and that he would arrive early. | He promised to work harder and to arrive early. |

## Common Patterns

**Lists:** Use the same form for all items.
- ❌ "The course covers writing, how to research, and citations."
- ✓ "The course covers writing, researching, and citing."

**Comparisons:** Match the structure on both sides.
- ❌ "Writing is harder than to speak."
- ✓ "Writing is harder than speaking."

**Pairs with correlatives (both/and, either/or, not only/but also):**
- ❌ "She not only writes essays but also is editing papers."
- ✓ "She not only writes essays but also edits papers."

> Parallel structure makes your writing more readable and professional.

## Quick Tip

When you have a list or comparison, check that each element follows the same grammatical pattern.
