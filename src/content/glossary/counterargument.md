A counterargument is an opposing viewpoint that you acknowledge and address. Rather than weakening your position, well-handled counterarguments strengthen your argument by showing intellectual honesty.

## The Counterargument Formula

1. **Present** the opposing view fairly
2. **Concede** what's valid about it
3. **Refute** why your position is still stronger
4. **Strengthen** your main argument

## Example

**Opposition:** "Some argue that social media helps teenagers maintain friendships across distances."

**Concession:** "It's true that social media can help teens stay connected with distant friends."

**Refutation:** "However, these benefits don't outweigh the psychological harms caused by addictive design features and social comparison pressures."

**Strengthening:** "The fact that social media offers some benefits while causing harm actually supports the case for thoughtful regulation."

## Common Mistakes

- **Straw man** — misrepresenting the opposing view
- **Dismissive tone** — "Anyone who disagrees is wrong"
- **Weak refutation** — not explaining *why* your position is stronger
- **Ignoring strong objections** — only addressing easy counterarguments

> The strongest arguments don't ignore opposition—they anticipate and address it.

## Quick Tips

- Address counterarguments before your conclusion
- Be fair to opposing views
- Use "while...however" structure
- Show why your evidence outweighs theirs
