A citation is a reference to a source used in your writing. It gives credit to original authors, allows readers to verify claims, and demonstrates research depth.

## When to Cite

- **Quote** directly from a source
- **Paraphrase** someone else's ideas
- **Summarize** research or findings
- **Use statistics** or data
- **Reference** specific facts that aren't common knowledge

## Major Citation Styles

| Style | Used In |
|-------|---------|
| **MLA** | Literature, humanities, arts |
| **APA** | Psychology, social sciences, education |
| **Chicago** | History, some humanities |

## In-Text Examples

**MLA:** "Social media affects teenagers" (Smith 45).

**APA:** "Social media affects teenagers" (Smith, 2020, p. 45).

**Chicago:** Social media affects teenagers.¹

> When in doubt, cite. It's better to over-cite than to risk plagiarism.

## Quick Tips

- Cite as you write, not after
- Keep track of all your sources
- Use citation management tools (Zotero, EasyBib)
