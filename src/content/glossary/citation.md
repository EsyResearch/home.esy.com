# Citation: Giving Credit Where It's Due

A citation is a reference to a source of information used in academic writing to give credit to original authors and allow readers to locate the original source. Proper citation is essential for academic integrity and helps build credibility for your arguments.

## Why Citations Matter

### Academic Integrity
- **Prevents plagiarism** by acknowledging original authors
- **Demonstrates honesty** in your research process
- **Shows respect** for intellectual property

### Credibility Building
- **Supports your arguments** with authoritative sources
- **Allows verification** of your claims
- **Demonstrates thorough research**

### Reader Service
- **Enables further reading** on the topic
- **Provides context** for your arguments
- **Creates a scholarly conversation**

## Types of Citations

### In-Text Citations
Brief references within your essay that point to full source information.

**MLA Example**: (Smith 45)
**APA Example**: (Smith, 2024, p. 45)

### Works Cited/References
Complete source information at the end of your paper.

**MLA Works Cited**:
```
Smith, John. "The Impact of Social Media." Journal of Communication, vol. 15, no. 3, 2024, pp. 42-58.
```

**APA References**:
```
Smith, J. (2024). The impact of social media. Journal of Communication, 15(3), 42-58.
```

## When to Cite

### Always Cite
- **Direct quotes** from any source
- **Paraphrased ideas** from other authors
- **Statistics and data** from research
- **Specific facts** not common knowledge
- **Images, charts, or graphs** from other sources

### No Citation Needed
- **Common knowledge** (Earth orbits the sun)
- **Your own original ideas** and analysis
- **Well-known historical dates** (World War II ended in 1945)
- **Widely accepted facts** in your field

## Common Citation Styles

### MLA (Modern Language Association)
- Used in **humanities** (literature, arts, philosophy)
- Author-page format: (Smith 45)
- Works Cited page

### APA (American Psychological Association)
- Used in **social sciences** (psychology, education, sociology)
- Author-date format: (Smith, 2024)
- References page

### Chicago/Turabian
- Used in **history** and some literature courses
- Footnotes or endnotes
- Bibliography

## Citation Best Practices

### During Research
1. **Record source information** immediately
2. **Use citation management tools** (Zotero, EndNote)
3. **Keep detailed notes** about what you've read
4. **Bookmark reliable sources** for easy access

### While Writing
1. **Cite as you write** - don't wait until the end
2. **Use signal phrases** to introduce sources
3. **Vary your citation methods** (quotes, paraphrases, summaries)
4. **Check style guide requirements** for your assignment

### Before Submitting
1. **Double-check all citations** for accuracy
2. **Ensure in-text citations match** your bibliography
3. **Verify URLs** are working and current
4. **Format consistently** throughout your paper

## Example Integration

Instead of just dropping in a quote:
> "Social media affects teenagers" (Smith 45).

Try integrating with context:
> According to communication researcher John Smith, "social media platforms significantly impact teenage social development and self-perception" (45).

## Red Flags to Avoid

- **Missing citations** for borrowed ideas
- **Inconsistent formatting** between citations
- **Unreliable sources** (Wikipedia, personal blogs)
- **Outdated information** without acknowledging age
- **Broken or missing URLs** for online sources

Remember: When in doubt, cite it out! It's better to over-cite than to accidentally plagiarize.
