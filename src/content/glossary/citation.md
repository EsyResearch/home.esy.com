## Overview

A citation is a reference to a source of information used in your writing. It serves multiple purposes: giving credit to original authors, allowing readers to verify your claims, and demonstrating the depth of your research.

## Usage

### Why Citations Matter
- **Academic integrity**: Shows you're not claiming others' ideas as your own
- **Reader verification**: Allows readers to check your sources
- **Research depth**: Demonstrates thorough research and engagement

### When to Cite
- **Quote directly** from a source
- **Paraphrase** someone else's ideas
- **Summarize** research or findings
- **Use statistics** or data

## Examples

### MLA In-Text Citation
```
"According to recent studies, social media usage has increased dramatically" (Smith 45).
```

### APA In-Text Citation
```
"Recent studies indicate that social media usage has increased dramatically" (Smith, 2020, p. 45).

## History

Citation practices evolved from medieval scholarly traditions. The modern academic citation system developed in the 19th century as universities formalized research standards and plagiarism prevention measures.
