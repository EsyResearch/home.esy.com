A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses (complete sentences) are incorrectly joined with only a comma.

## The Error

**Comma splice:** "I love writing, it helps me think clearly."

Both parts could stand alone as sentences, so a comma isn't enough to join them.

## How to Fix It

| Method | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Period** | I love writing. It helps me think clearly. |
| **Semicolon** | I love writing; it helps me think clearly. |
| **Conjunction** | I love writing, and it helps me think clearly. |
| **Subordination** | I love writing because it helps me think clearly. |

## More Examples

**Wrong:** "The experiment failed, we tried again."
**Right:** "The experiment failed, so we tried again."

**Wrong:** "She studied hard, she passed the exam."
**Right:** "She studied hard; she passed the exam."

> The easiest fix is often adding a conjunction (and, but, so, yet) after the comma.

## Quick Test

Cover everything after the comma. If what remains is a complete sentence, AND what follows the comma is also complete, you likely have a comma splice.
