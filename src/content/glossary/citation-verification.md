tldr: "Citation verification is the process of checking every source reference in AI-generated content against real databases — confirming that papers exist, authors match, DOIs resolve, and quotes are accurate. Without it, AI-generated research is unreliable by default."

## Why citations need verification

Language models hallucinate citations at high rates. A model asked to support a claim with sources will generate citation-shaped text — complete with author names, publication years, journal titles, and page numbers — that may reference papers that don't exist.

This isn't occasional. Research shows hallucinated citation rates between 30-70% depending on the model, prompt structure, and domain specificity.

The result: AI-generated content that *looks* well-sourced but contains fabricated evidence. This is worse than unsourced content, because it creates false confidence in the reader.

## What gets verified

A thorough citation verification pipeline checks:

- **Existence** — does the paper/article/book actually exist?
- **Metadata accuracy** — do the authors, year, journal, and title match?
- **DOI resolution** — does the DOI resolve to the correct source?
- **URL accessibility** — is the referenced URL live and returning the expected content?
- **Quote accuracy** — if a direct quote is attributed, does it appear in the source?
- **Claim alignment** — does the source actually support the claim it's cited for?

## How automated verification works

Automated citation verification typically follows this pipeline:

1. **Extraction** — parse citations from the generated content using structured patterns
2. **Database lookup** — query academic APIs (CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, PubMed) to confirm existence
3. **Metadata matching** — compare extracted metadata against database records
4. **Confidence scoring** — assign a verification confidence score to each citation
5. **Action** — verified citations pass through; failed citations are flagged, replaced, or removed

```
Generated text → Extract citations → Query databases → Score matches → Flag/remove failures
```

## The verification gap

Most AI tools skip this step entirely. The generation model produces output, and it's delivered to the user as-is. The user is expected to verify sources themselves — which defeats the purpose of automation.

This creates a fundamental trust problem: you can't publish AI-generated research if you have to manually verify every citation anyway. The automation provides no net value.

> Citation verification isn't a nice-to-have feature. It's the difference between an AI tool that produces publishable output and one that produces liability.

## Levels of verification

| Level | What it checks | Confidence |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| **None** | Nothing — raw model output | Unreliable |
| **Existence** | Paper exists in databases | Basic |
| **Metadata** | Authors, year, journal match | Moderate |
| **Content** | Quotes and claims align with source | High |
| **Full audit** | All above + accessibility + archival | Production-grade |

## Integration with agentic workflows

Citation verification is most effective when built into the workflow as a dedicated agent stage — not as a post-hoc check. When verification runs inline:

- Failed citations can be **replaced** with verified alternatives by a research agent
- The drafting agent can be **re-prompted** with corrected sources
- The final artifact ships with a **verification metadata layer** showing what was checked and what passed
