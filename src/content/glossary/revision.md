Revision is the process of re-seeing your work to improve its content, organization, and clarity. It's about making your writing better, not just correcting errors.

## Revision vs. Editing vs. Proofreading

| Stage | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Revision** | Big picture: ideas, structure, argument |
| **Editing** | Sentences: clarity, flow, word choice |
| **Proofreading** | Surface: spelling, punctuation, formatting |

## What to Look For

**Content:**
- Is my thesis clear and arguable?
- Do I have enough evidence?
- Are my points developed fully?

**Organization:**
- Is the structure logical?
- Do paragraphs flow smoothly?
- Are transitions effective?

**Argument:**
- Is my reasoning sound?
- Have I addressed counterarguments?
- Is the conclusion convincing?

## Revision Strategies

- **Read aloud** — hear awkward passages
- **Reverse outline** — summarize each paragraph to check structure
- **Take a break** — return with fresh eyes
- **Get feedback** — use peer review

> Revision is where good writing becomes great. Plan for multiple revision passes.

## Quick Tip

Revise in layers: first pass for argument and structure, second for paragraphs and transitions, third for sentences.
