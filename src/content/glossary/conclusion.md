The conclusion is your final opportunity to leave a lasting impression. It synthesizes your argument, emphasizes significance, and gives readers something to think about.

## Three-Part Structure

1. **Restate thesis** — remind readers of your argument (in new words)
2. **Summarize key points** — briefly recap main evidence
3. **Broader significance** — answer "So what?" or call to action

## Conclusion Types

- **Call to action** — urge specific steps
- **Broader implications** — connect to larger issues
- **Future-oriented** — predict what's next
- **Circular** — return to an image from your introduction

## Example

**Restatement:** "The evidence demonstrates that unregulated social media poses significant risks to adolescent well-being."

**Summary:** "Through addictive design, rising depression rates, and profit-driven decisions, we've seen how platforms prioritize engagement over health."

**Significance:** "This isn't just about teenagers—it's about protecting an entire generation and ensuring technology serves human well-being."

## Common Mistakes

- Introducing new arguments
- Simply copying your introduction
- Ending abruptly without closure
- Being overly emotional

> Your conclusion should synthesize, not summarize. Show how your points work together.

## Quick Tips

- Don't use "In conclusion" if avoidable
- Echo your introduction without repeating it
- Leave readers with something memorable
