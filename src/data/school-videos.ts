## What You'll Create

> A fully designed, source-linked infographic — exported as high-resolution PNG, scalable SVG, or print-ready PDF — built directly from your research data.

## How the Workflow Runs

### 1. Intake
Provide a citation, DOI, or plain-language topic. Optionally attach raw datasets or a brand color palette to keep the output on-identity.

### 2. Research
The engine pulls and parses the source material — extracting key statistics, relationships, and findings. A DOI resolves to the full paper automatically.

### 3. Design
Layout and chart types are selected based on data structure. Comparisons get bar charts, chronological data gets timelines, processes get flow diagrams. Nothing is templated — every visual is composed for the specific dataset.

### 4. Render
The infographic is generated at publication resolution. Brand colors are applied if you provided a palette; otherwise, a clean default scheme is used.

### 5. Artifact
Your finished infographic is ready to download. Every data point links back to the original source, so your audience can verify any claim on the graphic.

## What You'll Create

> A thesis-driven argumentative essay with sourced evidence, addressed counterarguments, and properly formatted citations — exported as DOCX or PDF.

## How the Workflow Runs

### 1. Intake
Provide your topic and your position. Optionally specify a target audience, required sources, or a particular angle — the more specific you are, the sharper the output.

### 2. Research
The engine gathers supporting evidence from academic databases and identifies the strongest counterarguments. Source quality is evaluated automatically — no Wikipedia deep-links making it into your bibliography.

### 3. Outline
A structured outline maps your thesis statement to specific evidence blocks. Each body section gets assigned sources, and every counterargument is paired with a planned rebuttal.

### 4. Draft
The full essay is composed section by section. Evidence is woven into the argument — not dumped in block quotes — and transitions maintain logical momentum from claim to claim.

### 5. Cite & Format
Citations are formatted in APA, MLA, or Chicago. The engine cross-checks every factual claim against its source and verifies that no counterargument is left unaddressed.

### 6. Artifact
Your finished essay is ready to download with formatted headers, in-text citations, and a complete bibliography.

## What You'll Create

> An interpretive analytical essay grounded in close reading, structured around a critical framework, with properly formatted textual citations — exported as DOCX or PDF.

## How the Workflow Runs

### 1. Intake
Provide the source text (or identify it by title), choose an analytical lens — feminist, Marxist, postcolonial, formalist, psychoanalytic, or your own — and specify a focus question to anchor the analysis.

### 2. Research
The engine performs a close reading, flagging patterns, motifs, structural choices, and moments of tension relevant to your chosen framework. It surfaces textual evidence you might have missed.

### 3. Outline
An analytical structure is assembled around your framework. Each section receives specific textual evidence and a clear interpretive claim, building toward a unified thesis.

### 4. Draft
The essay is composed with close attention to the evidence-to-analysis ratio. Quotes are integrated into sentences — not dropped in isolation — and every paragraph advances the argument.

### 5. Cite & Format
In-text citations are formatted correctly for direct quotes and paraphrases. Page numbers, line references, and act/scene markers are handled based on the source type.

### 6. Artifact
Your polished analytical essay is ready with a works-cited page, consistent formatting, and proper headers.

## How the Workflow Runs

### 1. Intake
Provide your topic, select the essay subtype (compare/contrast, cause/effect, process, or definition), and set the scope. The subtype selection determines the entire structural logic downstream.

### 2. Research
The engine gathers factual information, data, and expert perspectives. Sources are evaluated for reliability and relevance — prioritizing peer-reviewed material and authoritative references.

### 3. Outline
A logical structure is built specific to your subtype. Compare/contrast essays get point-by-point or block organization. Process essays get sequential stages. Cause/effect essays get clearly traced causal chains.

### 4. Draft
Clear, objective prose is composed. No persuasion, no opinion — just precise explanation. Each paragraph serves the structure, and transitions guide the reader through the logic without effort.

### 5. Cite & Format
All factual claims are attributed to sources. The engine ensures every statement is backed and formatting matches APA, MLA, or Chicago style consistently throughout.

## What You'll Create

> A vivid, arc-driven narrative essay that blends personal experience with reflective insight — formatted and polished as DOCX or PDF.

## How the Workflow Runs

### 1. Intake
Provide your theme or core experience, choose a narrative perspective (first-person or third-person), and optionally set a tone — reflective, urgent, humorous, bittersweet. The more specific your seed, the more distinct the voice.

### 2. Research
The engine researches contextual details that enrich your narrative — historical backdrop, sensory textures, cultural references, and setting-specific information that make scenes feel grounded rather than generic.

### 3. Outline
A story arc is constructed with a clear beginning, rising action, climax, and resolution. Key scenes are identified, sequenced, and assigned emotional beats that serve the larger theme.

### 4. Draft
Each scene is composed with attention to pacing, sensory detail, and dialogue. The narrative voice stays consistent — no sudden shifts from intimate to academic — and every paragraph earns its place in the arc.

### 5. Cite & Format
The essay is refined for voice consistency and emotional impact. Clichés are stripped. Vague generalizations are replaced with concrete, specific details. Pacing is tightened.

### 6. Artifact
Your finished narrative essay is ready with clean formatting and a polished final line.

### 3. Outline
A full paper structure is designed: introduction with thesis, literature review organized by theme or chronology, methodology section, findings, discussion, and conclusion. Each section gets assigned its sources and argumentative role.

### 4. Draft
The paper is composed section by section. The literature review synthesizes rather than summarizes. The discussion connects your findings to the broader scholarly conversation and acknowledges limitations honestly.

### 3. Outline
A narrative arc is built around your experiences. The structure connects who you were, what changed you, and why this program is the next chapter — without sounding formulaic.

### 4. Draft
Your essay is written with a focus on showing over telling. Specific details replace vague claims. Dialogue and scene-setting replace lists of accomplishments. The voice stays authentically yours.
