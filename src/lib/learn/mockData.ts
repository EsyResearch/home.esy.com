  markdown: `## Getting Started with Claude Code

Claude Code represents a paradigm shift in how developers interact with AI assistants. Unlike chat-based coding tools, Claude Code operates directly in your terminal with full access to your project context.

### Key Concepts

**Agentic Coding**: Claude Code doesn't just answer questions — it takes actions. It reads files, makes edits, runs commands, and verifies its own work. This is fundamentally different from copy-pasting code from a chat interface.

**Context-Aware**: By scanning your entire project structure, Claude Code understands your conventions, dependencies, and patterns. This means suggestions are tailored to your specific codebase, not generic templates.

### Setup Checklist

1. Install Node.js 18+ from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Run the global installation command
3. Create a CLAUDE.md file with your project conventions
4. Start your first session with \`claude\` in your project root

### Pro Tips

> **Tip**: Start with small, well-defined tasks to build confidence with the tool. As you learn its capabilities, gradually increase the complexity of your requests.

> **Tip at 0:36**: When describing bugs, always include the expected behavior, actual behavior, and steps to reproduce.`,

  "We're going to look at multi-file refactoring, test-driven development, and architecture scaffolding.",
  "Let's start with multi-file refactoring — one of Claude Code's strongest capabilities.",
  "Imagine you need to rename a component and update all its imports across 50 files.",
  "Instead of find-and-replace, describe the refactoring goal and let Claude Code handle it.",
  "It will find all usages, update imports, rename files, and adjust tests accordingly.",
  "The key is to be explicit about what should change and what should stay the same.",
  "For example: 'Rename UserProfile to AccountProfile everywhere, including tests and styles.'",
  "Claude Code will generate a comprehensive diff showing every file that was modified.",
  "Now let's talk about test-driven development with Claude Code.",
  "You can write your test cases first, then ask Claude Code to implement the code that passes them.",
  "This is incredibly powerful for maintaining code quality and catching edge cases.",
  "Describe the function signature, the expected inputs and outputs, and the edge cases.",
  "Claude Code will write both the implementation and verify it passes your tests.",
  "Moving on to architecture scaffolding — creating entire features from a description.",
  "You can describe a feature like 'Add a user settings page with email, password, and notification preferences.'",
  "Claude Code will create the route, components, API endpoints, and database queries.",
  "It follows your existing patterns, so the new code feels consistent with your codebase.",
  "Another powerful pattern is iterative refinement through multi-turn conversations.",
  "After Claude Code makes changes, you can say 'the styling needs more padding' or 'add error handling here.'",
  "Each iteration builds on the previous context, so you don't need to repeat yourself.",
  "This conversational approach makes complex tasks manageable and incremental.",
  "Let's also discuss error recovery. When something goes wrong, Claude Code can help debug.",
  "Paste an error message and describe the context. Claude Code will trace the issue and fix it.",
  "It can also run your test suite and fix failing tests automatically.",
  "This creates a tight feedback loop: describe → implement → test → fix → ship.",
  "Now let's look at some real-world examples of these patterns in action.",
  "In our demo project, we'll refactor an authentication system from JWT to session-based.",
  "This involves changes to middleware, API routes, database schema, and client-side code.",
  "Watch how Claude Code orchestrates all these changes in a single conversation.",
  "The result is a clean, comprehensive refactoring with no manual file hunting.",
  "That's the power of agentic coding — the AI handles the tedious parts while you direct the strategy.",

This lesson covers the patterns that separate novice Claude Code users from power users. These techniques can 10x your productivity on complex tasks.

### Multi-File Refactoring

The key to successful refactoring with Claude Code:
- **Be explicit about scope**: Tell it which directories to touch and which to leave alone
- **Specify naming conventions**: "Use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components"
- **Include edge cases**: "Also update the storybook files and the API documentation"

### Test-Driven Development Flow

\`\`\`
1. Write test cases with expected behavior
2. Ask Claude Code to implement the feature
3. Run tests to verify
4. Iterate on failures
5. Ship with confidence
\`\`\`

### Architecture Scaffolding

When creating new features, provide Claude Code with:
- The feature description (what it does)
- The data model (what entities exist)
- The user flow (how users interact)
- Reference files (existing patterns to follow)`,

Three battle-tested frameworks for getting consistent, high-quality research outputs from ChatGPT.

### Framework 1: SCOPE

S — Situation:  Who you are, what stage of research
C — Context:    Background on your topic/project  
O — Objective:  Exactly what you want produced
P — Parameters: Constraints (dates, sources, format)
E — Examples:   Show the desired output format
\`\`\`

### Framework 2: PEEL

Use this when you want academically structured arguments:
- **P**oint — Clear thesis statement
- **E**vidence — Supporting data and citations
- **E**xplain — Analysis of how evidence supports the point
- **L**ink — Connection to broader research question

### Framework 3: Socratic Dialogue

Instead of asking for answers, ask for challenges:
- "What are the counterarguments to this thesis?"
- "What methodological weaknesses does this study have?"
- "What alternative interpretations exist for these findings?"

### Chain Prompting for Complex Tasks

Break research into sequential stages where each output feeds the next input. This produces deeper, more nuanced analysis than any single prompt.`,

### Project Setup

**Topic**: The impact of remote work on urban planning in post-pandemic cities  
**Format**: 2000-word research brief for an urban planning conference  
**Constraint**: 10+ citations, studies from 2021-2024, 3+ countries

### Workflow Applied

1. **Planning** (SCOPE) → Research questions + outline
2. **Literature Review** (Chain Prompting) → Summarize → Compare → Synthesize
3. **Thesis Development** (Socratic Dialogue) → Stress-test arguments
4. **Writing** (PEEL) → Structured draft sections
5. **Verification** → Cross-reference all citations
6. **Refinement** → Consistency check + strengthen weak sections

Effective educational infographics are grounded in cognitive science and visual communication theory. This lesson covers the principles that separate good infographics from great ones.

### The Visual Communication Hierarchy

1. **Title** — The single most important takeaway
2. **Subtitle** — Context in 1-2 sentences
3. **Body Sections** — Logical flow of information
4. **Data Visualizations** — Evidence and patterns
5. **Call to Action** — What should the reader do next?

### Chart Selection Guide

| Data Type | Best Chart | Avoid |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Comparison | Bar chart | Pie chart (>4 items) |
| Trend over time | Line chart | Bar chart |
| Part of whole | Stacked bar | 3D pie chart |
| Relationship | Scatter plot | Table |
| Process | Flowchart | Bullet list |

### Cognitive Science Foundations

**Mayer's Principles** that apply to infographics:
- **Multimedia Principle**: People learn better from words + pictures than words alone
- **Spatial Contiguity**: Place text near related graphics
- **Coherence**: Remove extraneous material
- **Signaling**: Use visual cues to highlight organization`,

  "The key concept is 'structured input'. The better your input, the better the output.",
  "Let's start by defining our infographic topic: 'The Rise of Remote Work 2020-2024.'",
  "First, we'll prepare our data. I have statistics on remote work adoption across industries.",
  "Technology leads at 67% fully remote, followed by finance at 42%, and education at 38%.",
  "We also have trend data showing year-over-year growth in remote work percentages.",
  "And qualitative data on employee satisfaction and productivity changes.",
  "Now let's input this into Nano Banana using the structured format.",
  "The format requires: title, sections, data points, and optional visual preferences.",
  "Watch as I define each section with its data and preferred visualization type.",
  "Section one: 'Adoption by Industry' — I'll use a horizontal bar chart.",
  "Section two: 'Year-over-Year Growth' — a line chart with annotations for key events.",

This lesson walks through the complete workflow from data preparation to finished visual artifact.

### The Structured Input Format

\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "The Rise of Remote Work 2020-2024",
  "sections": [
    {
      "heading": "Adoption by Industry",
      "type": "bar-chart",

    }
  ],
  "style": {
    "palette": "navy-teal",
    "layout": "vertical-scroll"
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Iteration Tips

1. **Start with structure** — get the layout right before polishing visuals
2. **Check data accuracy** — verify numbers against source material
3. **Test readability** — zoom to 50% and see if the main message is still clear
4. **Add sources** — academic credibility requires attribution

### Export Formats

  markdown: `## Advanced Infographic Techniques

Level up your infographic game with animations, interactivity, and series design.

### Animation Best Practices

- **Progressive reveal**: Show data points one at a time
- **Timing**: 200-400ms per transition, 1-2s pause between sections
- **Easing**: Use ease-out for entrances, ease-in-out for transitions
- **Duration**: Total animation under 60 seconds for social media

### Interactive Features

Nano Banana supports these interaction types:
1. **Hover tooltips** — Show exact values on data points
2. **Filter controls** — Let users focus on specific categories
3. **Zoom** — Enable detail view for dense visualizations
4. **Toggle** — Switch between different data views

### Series Design System

When creating a multi-part series:
- Lock the color palette across all infographics
- Use consistent typography and spacing
- Number or label each part clearly
- Include visual navigation between parts
- Maintain a consistent aspect ratio

### Accessibility Requirements

Every infographic must include:
- Descriptive alt text (100+ characters)
- A data table equivalent for screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Text that doesn't rely on color alone to convey meaning`,
